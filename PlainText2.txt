Foreword
“KNOWLEDGE is that which is acquired
 through personal experiences”
- Thiruvalluvar
The paramount duty of schools is to provide quality education through a curriculum frame
work. Quality education is comprised of dimensions like enriching the innate potential of learners,
inculcation of self-discipline, enabling the students to assimilate the best learning experiences in every
subject and creating interest in learning among students.
Curriculum is revised from time to time based on the changing needs of learners and their
environment. NCERT, New Delhi has designed National Curriculum Frame Work 2005 (NCF 2005)
bearing in mind the contextual and professional needs of all the stake holders of education.
The following five cardinal principles of NCF 2005 have been assimilitated into teacher
education curriculum and in the source books of Elementary Teacher Education which are to be
introduced in 2008-2009.
! Connecting knowledge to life outside the school
! Ensuring that learning shifts away from rote methods
! Enriching the curriculum so that it goes beyond textbooks
! Making Examinations more flexible and integrating them with classroom life.
! Nurturing an overriding identity informed by caring concerns within the democratic polity of the
country.
The curriculum developed by DTERT is likely to develop the following skills in student-teachers
of Elementary Teacher Education.
! The ability to seek knowledge continuously
! Skill of applying acquired knowledge to various situation
! Skill to realize the inner potential and live in harmony with others accordingly and learn to
live in coordination with the members of the society
! Mastery of learning in all the subjects
! Skill for doing constructive activities
( iii )
! The proficiency of student-teachers in innovations, doing Research and the ability to think
telelogically
The curriculum has the following objectives:
! To enhance the professionalism of student-teachers and develop their holistic personality
! To nurture values such as national integration, milk of human kindness and moral values
! To give importance to Adolescence Education, Health Education, Life Skills Education,
Environmental Education, Road Safety and Peace Education.
To facilitate the realization of the above objectives, eight subjects and nine practicums have been

( v )
There is a paradigm shift from teaching to self –learning through Activity Based Learning strategy.
These new source books have been designed with self-learning through Activity Based Learning
Strategy. These new source books have been designed with self-learning activities enabling student
teachers to master various concepts and skills. The sourcebooks shall guide student teachers to
explore library resources to reinforce their teaching strategies to ensure maximum learning among
children to improve their skills of observation, classroom management, content knowledge, skill to use
TLM and TLE appropriately, Leadership traits and Knowledge of Child Psychology.
Source books are not text books. They are simply guides which show where resources are
available for reference and learning. From the identified resources learning needs are to be expanded.
The duties of the teacher educators are to learn, understand, analyse, consolidate and evaluate. The
duties of the student teachers are to assimilate teaching ideas and learn well to become reflective
practitioners.
I commend all the educationists and teacher educators involved in the process of preparing the
source book and also congratulate the prospective student teachers who are likely to be benefited from
the Diploma in Teacher Education Source books.

A note to the teacher educators
The DTE source books have a paradigm shift in the treatment of all the subjects.
They are learner-centric. In each unit there are suggested activities leading to the
lesson that will provide opportunities for exploration during the lesson and further
enquiry and expansion of concepts being learnt. Learning has been designed in such a
way that student-teachers construct knowledge based on their prior experiences and in
close interaction with peers and teacher-educators.
Student-teachers and learners at the primary level cannot sustain their interest
in learning if they are unable to connect what they learn in school to what they have
already learnt before coming to the Teacher Training Institute or school respectively.
So, the activities have been designed by the authors to enable the student-teachers to
become not mere transmitters of knowledge but reflective practitioners. In an
unprecedented manner, reflective logs have also been introduced to give a wide scope
for the student-teachers to record their impressions during internship. The logs shall
help teacher-trainees try wearing a professorial garb in teaching.
The new source books are replete with questions challenging the skills,
understanding and application. Knowledge-based questions have been reduced to the
minimum. This discourages rote learning to a great extent. Teacher educators have the
liberty to exploit the resources listed as references in each unit to enhance understanding
in the student-teachers and they should refrain from using source books as textbooks.
Even the methods explained are not prescriptive and teacher-educators are encouraged
to explore further innovative ways of teaching lessons. Learning is experiential and
activity based in all the source books.
The Sourcebooks do not, as a rule, prescribe any teaching method as the best
but have laid out various methods for trying out and selecting the appropriate ones
with a lot of scope for exploration and innovation .The blue-print and model paper will
help teacher-educators really evaluate how and to what extent the student-teachers
have developed knowledge, skills and application abilities required of facilitators in
students’learning.
In the present context, teacher - educator shall facilitate student-teachers to
observe and create a profile of students they are going to teach in their internship.
There shall be greater understanding of the needs and concerns of fellow studentteachers.
There will be teaching practice classes all the year round giving a wide scope
for collaborative learning and peer correction. Each of those classes will also be reflected
upon by the individual and the class as a whole.

IV. DRAFTING TELEGRAMS / SMS
Telegram is a means of communication that can be delivered within a short
span of time. Even though the telephone tries to fit into the place of Telegram,
it can’t be denied that telegram is a record.
Imagine you are staying in a hostel. You wish to join the Tour team. You need
money urgently. So you are sending a telegram to your father.
SEND RS. 2000/- BY M.O. SCHOOL TOUR NEXT WEEK
Only limited and important words are used and not full sentences.
NOW YOU CAN TRY :
1. Your uncle Mr. Giri is admitted in Appollo Hospital, Chennai, because of a
heart attack. As he is seriously ill with no hope of reviving the doctor asks you
to inform your relatives. Prepare a telegram.
2. A Government servant whose native place is 200 Kms away from her working
spot, goes home for the holidays. Unfortunately she falls ill . She has to request
her office for 2 days of casual leave. Help her do so.
3. You are trying to get a bank loan for your friend in a distant place. It is confirmed
that your friend can be given Rs. 1,00,000/- from the bank. Prepare a telegram
to inform him of the matter.
4. Imagine a situation and write a suitable telegram too.
DRAFTING SMS
Short Message Service is a communications protocol allowing the interchange
of short text messages between mobile telephone users.
In modern times, SMS has replaced the usage of greeting cards. Often we send
SMS to communicate our ideas to our near and dear ones. There are predesigned
templates for different occasions. Using such templates saves time.
Happy New Year
Happy Pongal, dear friend
Hai, how R U ?
Wel n gud
Thank U
Rn’t U wel ?

Have you noticed how words are shortened? Analyse how the SMS texts
differ from Telegrams.
1. A few contexts are given here. Prepare SMS/ text messages.
1. During Birthdays : …………………………….....................................
2. Desirous to know where is your friend? : …………………………..................
3. Instructing your friend : …………………………….....................................

Got it. Thank U Angry for not calling
Note :
SMS is a system of providing the quickest means of communication in a brief a manner
It therefore employs brevity of words through representation or sounds. It is for this
reason that SMS words are numbers and letters or alphabets accordingly.
e.g., How are you - how are u?
You are too good to be true - U’ r 2 gud 2 b true.
3. Write a few SMS/text messages you have received from your friend.
V. DEVELOPING TOPIC SENTENCES INTO PARAGRAPHS
(a) Read the following paragraph :
Standard procedures for treatment of heart related diseases are expensive. A
private hospital, despite having good intentions, will expect the patient to pay,
Rs. 30,000 for a week’s stay. If we add the cost of investigations and the cost of
injections, saline bottles, medicines and other medical necessities, the total
will be close to Rs. 1,60,000/-
The underlined sentence is the topic sentence – “the main idea of the
paragraph”. It is generally found at the beginning of a paragraph but not always.
The other sentences in the paragraph give “supporting details” to the topic
sentence. The supporting sentences can be examples, details, facts, reasons
or incidents.
Go through the following paragraph and underline the topic sentence.
A dog can be taught many tricks to obtain rewards of food and praise. In order
to make the final stages of training, work best, the trainer must withhold the
reward till the animal has successfully performed the entire behaviour, it has
learned. Instead, if the trainer were to continue to reward the initial lying
down behaviour, the animal simply would repeat that behaviour over and over
to get food and affection.
Have you underlined the topic sentence?

renovate the playground of the school. One of the group members will act as
the chairperson and conduct the meeting. The committee should decide the
budget, duration of the project and plan for implementation.
The details of the existing playground are as follows :
Area : 5000 Sq. Yards.
Available Courts : Tennis Court – 1
Badminton Courts – 2
Students’ demands : 1. a swimming pool

IX. REPORT WRITING :
Look at this report from the Hindu, dated 17.01.2008
titled “Books delving into Tirukkural released”.
Read this report and answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of this report?
2. What kind of language has been used? Active or passive
voice? First person or third person account?
3. Is the presentation clear and accurate?
4. Does the report have the significant details such as what,
who and how?
A Report is an accurate and objective description or
account of significant events which could be political,
social and academic. A report should be simple and clear;
and in third person point of view using the passive voice.
Work in teams of three or four. Each team of ‘engineers’
is going to have a design and build a ‘bridge’ between
two tables, using only the following materials:
One sheet of A4 paper and Two paper clips
15
Your bridge must span a gap between two tables without collapsing and without
being physically supported by the engineers themselves. The winning group
will be the one that builds the LONGEST bridge.
You will only be given ONE piece of paper and no extra pieces will be supplied,
so don’t fold it, cut it or tear it until your group has reached a consensus on
how to construct it. It might be wise to make sketches of your design before
starting construction.
Write a report on how each team worked on this.

city grew to be a very suitable capital for the Thai Kingdom.
Bangkok is not smaller in any sense when compared to any of the

preserved and cherished. At the same time the city is modern. Nowhere
else you will find people who are genuinely proud, gentle and ready to
please everyone.

available widely.
Language : Thai is the national language while English is widely
understood in Bangkok and other major cities of
Thailand.

This content area is designed to provide adequate activities in functional grammar
for the teacher trainees to carry out in the classroom. The task-based
treatment of items like nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, types of sentences,
sentence patterns, articles, prepositions, modals, tense form, degrees of comparison
and reported speech will go a long way in sharpening the communicative
skills of both the trainees and children.
These activities will enhance the skills of trainees which they have already
acquired at the Higher Secondary Course. Among the activities some are at
students’ level to facilitate the classroom teaching and some are at trainees’
level to enrich their application of grammar.
It is hoped that the trainees will not only experience a great pleasure in executing
the activities but also eliminate the fear of grammar in their students.

UNIT - 1
 OBJECTIVES OF LEARNING ENGLISH
Need for learning English
English is not the most widely
spoken language in the world in
terms of the number of native
speakers. There are many more
Chinese speakers than native
English speakers but Chinese is
spoken little outside of Chinese
communities. However English is
the most widespread language in the
world. It is difficult to estimate
exactly how many English speakers
there are, but according to one estimate there are more than 350,000,000
native English speakers and more than 400,000,000 speakers of English as a
second language (a language used in everyday life, even though it is not the
native language) or foreign language (a language studied but not used much in
everyday life).
However, even these numbers do not really indicate how important English is as
a world language, because less than fifteen percent of the world population uses
English. The importance of English is not just in how many people speak it but in
what it is used for. English is the major language of news and information in the
world. It is the language of business and government even in some countries
where it is a minority language. It is the language of maritime communication,
international air traffic control, and it is used even for internal air traffic control
in countries where it is not a native language.
USES OF ENGLISH
English for News and Information
English is commonly used as a medium for the communication of information and
news. Three quarters of all telex messages and telegrams are sent in English.
Eighty percent of computer data are processed and stored in English. Much satellite
communication is carried in English. Five thousand newspapers, more than half
of the newspapers published in the world, are published in English. Even in many
countries where English is a minority language, there is at least one newspaper
in English. In India alone, there are three thousand magazines published in
English. In many countries, television news is broadcast in English. Because of
the power of television, demonstrators in every country use signs printed in English
for the benefit of the international press.
English for Business, Diplomacy, and the Professions
English is a major language of international business, diplomacy, science and
the professions. It is the language that an Iranian businessman and a Japanese

in countries where few people speak English on the street, people who work with
tourists generally speak English. In some countries even drivers of buses or
streetcars and sellers at newsstands speak English well.
Other Uses of English:
In many former British colonies, English is still used in the government and as a
medium of communication among people who do not have another language in
common. In some cases, it is a neutral language that is used to avoid giving any
one indigenous language too much prestige. English is often used in India, because
it is neutral. It is the language of the government. People who speak English have
a certain status in society. It is used for books, music and dance. In Singapore,
English is a second language, but it is necessary for daily life. Many companies
there use English. In addition, sixteen countries in Africa have retained English
as the language of the government. Now standard English is taught in schools in
those countries, because it is necessary for careers.
English is also studied as a foreign language in countries where it is not generally
used as a medium of communication. In China, English language lessons are
popular TV programs. Two hundred and fifty million Chinese-more than the
population of the US--are learning English on TV. English is usually the first or
businessman are likely to use to
communicate. Important commodities
such as silver, tin, and hard currency are
traded in English. English is also an
official language of many professional and
international organizations including the
United Nations.
ENGLISH FOR ENTERTAINMENT
Popular culture:
Popular culture has also played an
important part in spreading English.
American and British popular music are
heard all over the world. American movies
are seen in almost every country. Books
in English are available even in countries
where very few people actually use
English. One reason that students give
for learning English is to understand
these songs, movies and books.
Travel :
English is also very important for
international travel. Much of the
information, countries disseminate about
themselves outside of their borders, is in
English. English is spoken in large hotels
and tourist attractions, at airports, and
in shops that tourists frequent. There are
travel brochures printed in English, and
TV news is available in English. Tours are
almost always available in English. Even
English as a First or
Second Language
In some countries, English is the
sole or dominant language. It has
that role in the United Kingdom,
the United States, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, and
Ireland. All of these countries
are former British colonies. In
other countries, English is
widely used, particularly among
people who have no other
language in common, even
though it is not the dominant
language of the country. For
example, English is widely used
in Hong Kong, Singapore,
Nigeria, the Philippines, and
Malaysia. In such countries, it is
often used as a means of
communication between people
who have different native
languages. In many states of
India, English is used as an
official language. Non-Hindi
speaking states communicate
with the centre using English.
54
most commonly taught foreign language in many countries, and people understand
it a little at least.
International Schools in India :
International Schools in India are the popular choice among the Asian parents.
There are over few thousand International children who are currently enrolled at
various International schools in India. In India, there are over 100 International
Schools with curricula such as International Baccalaureate (IB) or IGCSE from
the University of Cambridge. The curriculum at these schools is same as those at
various International Schools in native English-speaking countries such as
Australia, Canada or New Zealand.
Today, parents send their children to International Schools in India because:
! All education at International Schools in India is in English - just like in
USA, UK and Australia
! Indian schooling education is recognized worldwide
! New Generation International Schools in India have new modern
infrastructure
! Very affordable: All inclusive annual cost can be as low as US$3,500 -
inclusive of all tuition fees and living expenses.
Going by sheer numbers, India is the third largest English-speaking country in
the world. At least 30 million Indians (four per cent of our population) regularly
use English. A further unquantifiably large number of us use English in some
way, with varying competence and knowledge of the language.
English for updating knowledge and career choices :
Today English has gained the status of enabling individuals to negotiate their
own salaries with their Multi-national employers. Call centre, Medical Script
Transcription, DATA transfer centres, Digital publishing houses and Human
Resource Personnel Departments require young persons with a command of oral
and written English. Many private firms in India, China and Japan offer crash
courses in English .Many foreign nationals come to India to learn communicative
English. Besides, a lot of information on the availability of various types of jobs
and information on various subjects are hosted in various websites in English
and even interviews are conducted in English through web cams.
Position of English in India :
English was the language of industrialization and modernization, and now it is
the language of globalization. Mother tongues or regional languages have failed to
create market value for themselves and only English sells. English has acquired
social value. Knowledge of English is seen to be the key to economic prosperity.
Parents, especially those belonging to the middle and upper classes, expect their
children to get the best type of education and they conclude that it is possible
only through English medium. People from the lower classes emulate the modelsetting
behavior of the middle and upper classes. So, we find that the English
medium schools are opened everywhere in the country!
The perception of the policy makers, the recommendations and guidelines of the
educationists, and the legal implications of the official guidelines as regards
language choice and medium do not go well with the perception of the parents.
55
India has the largest middle class and this middle class has demonstrated its
desire to go in for English as the medium of instruction. This has led to an
incompatibility between the policy and its effective implementation. Like in many
spheres of national life, the policy is kept as an ideal, but its implementation is
always half-hearted.
The best course is to draw a policy that reflects the aspirations of the people
rather than the aspirations of the ideologues and politicians, and strike a balance
between the demands of national and regional identities and goals of education.
Most people would like to see that English has an active role in the education of
their children. They want their children to acquire effective skills in English,
even as they have some competence in the Indian language of their choice. The
problem is compounded by the fact that more and more students prefer to take
Hindi or a European language, in lieu of their mother tongues or the dominant
language of the state. Thousands of students come out of schools without knowing
how to read and write in their own mother tongue. This is perfectly legal, although
it is a tragedy. This worries the state governments who see in it a threat to the
identity of the dominant language of the state. The Indian worldview looks at
getting jobs abroad as the most important goal of school education. This has
added to the complexity of the situation.
Social factors promoting English in Schools:
Irrespective of the economic status, parents do want to provide education in English
to their children. Many deem it a matter of pride to hear their children recite
poems , sing nursery rhymes and speak in English. Catering to the parental
demand for English Education, many private schools have sprung in many parts of
the country. Government also takes earnest efforts to make learning of English
attractive. In Tamilnadu , the state has opened up many language labs making
interactive learning of English possible. Besides plenty of English VCDs prepared
by RIE, Mysore and ETV studio of DTERT are used in all the Government, Municipal
and Corporation Middle Schools and High Schools to enable children to listen to
good English and to speak in English. Computer Assisted Learning Centres of
SSA also provide excellent inter active learning opportunities for children in
Government schools.
Psychological Factors and English Speaking:
For the past several decades, with the development of the international
communication, English has become the world language. The teaching of oral
English is improved to priority in the nations using English as a foreign language,
including China. However, there has been a heated debate over the English
speaking ability of students. Many linguists, educationists, and even the common
English teachers have been devoted to explore the ways of improving spoken
English. They investigated the factors related to the English speaking, such as
social factors, teachers’ influences, learners’ strategies. These researches
achieved a great success in the establishment of the concerning theories. However,
based on these researches, our teaching methods and techniques, to a larger
extent, still failed to produce effective English speaking. To discover the reason
any researcher turns to study the learners’ psychology. Nowadays we have become
increasingly aware that individual learners are different from each other. They
have their own personalities, motivations, and other psychological characteristics.
These elements affect how learners act in the spoken English learning.
56
Important Psychological Factors in Spoken English Teaching and Learning:
Language is a tool of communication, so too is English. The ultimate aim of English
teaching is to cultivate the students’ ability of speaking and communication. Among
the four skills of English learning----reading, writing, listening and speaking,
reading is perhaps the easiest, while speaking the most difficult to acquire(Huang
X & M Van Naerssen., 1985: 287-307). That is because speaking is an active
skill, requiring students to combine the words into sentences without preparation,
and no time to revise.
During this process, learners show their differences, some can draw and organize
the information in their mind flexibly, and then speak it out fluently; others can’t
organize the words they want to express in a reasonable and logical way, even
though they have mastered much knowledge and are eager to express. One of the
important reasons is due to their psychological characteristics.
English speaking is a complicated psychological process. In terms of spoken English
teaching in schools, it’s quite essential for teachers and learners to take some
important psychological factors into accounts in order to achieve better results in
spoken English teaching and learning. This part is a contribution to discuss some
important psychological factors concerned.
According to the studies, the factors which affect English speaking are motivation,
anxiety, extroversion, self-esteem and self-concept.
Motivation:
There are three basic kinds of motivation---intrinsic motivation, extrinsic
motivation and integrated motivation in general learning theory. It is clear that
these three kinds of motivation don’t exclude each other. Most learners are
motivated by these reasons in the oral English learning. In learning spoken
English, just like other fields of human learning, motivation is the crucial force
that determines whether a learner embarks on a spoken task at all, how much
energy he devotes to it and how long he preserves it. It is a complex phenomenon
and includes many components: the individual’s drive, need for achievement and
success, curiosity, desire for stimulation and new experience, and so on.
It is clear that learners with high and favorable motivation for speaking often try
to devote themselves into English speaking. In English class, they are active, and
cooperate with teachers’ activities positively. Out of class, they take any opportunity
for imitating, practicing and speaking English. They are of strong volition and
will, of clear learning purpose. Thereby, they easily and more proficiently achieve
success in spoken English .In their turn, the success encourages higher
motivation.
Anxiety:
Anxiety is a sense of worry, a kind of subconscious scare. Classroom anxiety
includes “trait anxiety” and “environmental anxiety”. The two kinds of anxiety
can enforce or reduce each other’s effects in an English speaking classroom.
Furthermore, they are both bad for the improvement of students’ spoken English.
In this aspect, the “environmental anxiety” is sounder than the “trait anxiety”.
Teachers are the main factor to cause classroom anxiety and it is suggested
that they should pay much attention to their teaching attitude and behavior to
create a happy atmosphere.
However, the level of anxiety felt by learners is only partly a result of the nature
of the situation itself. It is also the result of personal factors. For example, some
57
learners become anxious more quickly than others, whatever the situation is;
others may have had experiences of failure which cause them to become anxious
quickly in classroom learning situation.
From the above, we can conclude that too or over anxiety hinders learning process
as well as English speaking, but it seems that a certain amount of it can stimulate
a learner to invest more energy in their task.
Self-esteem:
Self-esteem refers to the individual’s evaluation on himself, an attitude towards
his or her ability, value, and achievement. It is originated from individual’s
experience and the judge of the outside world. Comparatively speaking, learners
with high self-esteem are full of the sense of self-confidence and self-affirmation.
In English learning, they can evaluate reasonably and objectively their own English
level as well as the other learning skills---listening, reading, writing, speaking
and translating.
Self-esteem was associated with the English speaking, and that learners with
high self-esteem could have more chances to achieve speaking proficiency.
Presumably, they are less likely to feel threatened when speaking or
communicating in English or in an unfamiliar situation. They may also be more
ready to risk making mistakes or projecting a reduced image of them.
Extroversion:
Irrespective of actual English learning ability, learners with an outgoing personality
may enjoy certain advantages in English speaking. Their active nature may
promote them to open their mouth in class or out of class. They are willing to be
involved in more spoken activities and social interaction, attract more attention
from their teachers and be less inhibited when asked to display their proficiency
(e.g. in oral interviews). They may perform more confidently in communication
situations when they use English.
Self-concept :
Self-concept is an integrated psychological factor, and it determines the four
previous psychological factors and is reflected in the four factors--- motivation,
anxiety, self-esteem and extroversion. Self-concept plays a great role in promoting
students’ motivation, in decreasing their anxiety, in increasing their self-esteem.
A positive self-concept is the base of the establishment of the healthy psychological
Exploration
• Visit a local Library and trace the history of English in India
• Go in pairs to different streets of the town or village where you study and
interview parents and collect their views on learning of English
• Visit a nearby Multi national company and find out how they develop the
communicative competence of the employees
• Find out the Institutes offering courses on English in the nearby city and
share the information with your friends
• Invite a speaker from a nearby town or University or from British council to
explain the opportunities available for learners of English in India and
abroad

quality. In English class, a student’s self-concept is correlated closely with his
own psychological quality, the relationship between teachers and students, and
the relationship among students. If teachers and students have good impression
on a learner, he would be more self-confident, and try his best to achieve more
with higher motivation.
We can conclude that active self-evaluation is of great importance in improving
students’ English level. To a great extent, the students’ proficient learning skills
rely on the proper evaluation of their self-image.

ORAL SKILLS
Scope :
skills in themselves and the children. There is a wide range of skills dealt with in
this unit such as Classroom English, Telling Stories, Creating Situations for
dialogue, Language Games and Activities, Use of language in social gatherings,
Conducting Interviews and Telephone Conversation. Plenty of activities have been
given for each skill.
Classroom Language:
A very important way of helping pupils progress from dependence on the book and
on the teacher to self-dependence is to give them the necessary tools. One of the
tools is classroom language.
For example, most children do not know the answer to a question as they do not
understand it and do not know how to ask for help. So teaching them phrases
like, 'I'm sorry, I don't know' or '1 don't understand' develops their ability to
communicate meaningfully in the classroom and elsewhere. Here are some
phrases which your pupils should use. Note that they should be taught as phrases,
not as words or structures. Children are only interested in what the phrases are
used for.
Good morning/afternoon
Goodbye
Speaking is perhaps the most
demanding skill for the teacher to
teach. In their own language children
are able to express emotions,
communicate intentions and
reactions, explore the language and
make fun of it, so they are expected
to be able to do the same in English.
What is important with beginners is
finding the balance between
providing language through controlled
and guided activities and at the same
time letting them enjoy natural talk.
Most of our pupils have little
opportunity to practise speaking
English outside the classroom and so
need lots of practise when they are
in the class.
This unit aims at sharpening the
skills of the teachers in such a way
that they will be able to develop oral

Sorry, I don't know/don't
understand/can't.
What's this called in English? What's
the English for?
Whose turn is it,/book is this/chair
is this?
Whose turn is it to?
Listening in the classroom :
It is quite clear that listening is the
skill that children acquire first, especially if they have not yet learnt to read.
When the pupils start to learn a foreign language, it goes in mainly through their
ears. So what the pupils hear is their main source of the language. Of course, we
also give them as much visual back-up as possible through facial expression,
through movement, through mime and through pictures.
When you are telling a story, you don't have to tell it from beginning to end
without breaks. You can re-tell it again and again as you go along:
'This story starts on a nice. sunny Monday morning. Who's the story about?. Who
can we see in the picture? Yes, Suman and Babu. It's a nice, sunny Monday
morning and Suman and Babu are. ... Where are they? In the forest. Right.
They're in the forest. And what are they doing? They're picking berries. So, it's a
nice, sunny Monday morning, and Suman and Babu are in the forest picking
berries. What happens next? Well. . . .' And so the story continues.
Mime stories:
In a mime story, the teacher tells the story and the pupils and the teacher do the
actions. It again provides physical movement and gives the teacher a chance to
play along with the pupils.
Here's a very simple example of a mime story:
'We're sitting in a boat, a small rowing boat. Let's row. We row and row. Now
what's that? A bird. A big bird is flying over the water. Now it's gone. We keep

Try to speak English as much of the time
as you can, using mime, acting, puppets
and any other means you can think of
to get your meaning across .
rowing. Can we see the bird? No,
no bird. This is hard work. Row,
row. We're tired. We row slowly.
There's the shore. Let's go home
now. We're so tired we're dragging
our feet. We're tired. We want to
go to sleep. We lie down on our
beds. We close our eyes, and . . . .
shhhh. . . . We’re asleep'.
'Listen and repeat' activities:
'Listen and repeat' exercises are
great fun and give the pupils the
chance to get a feel for the
Specific Objectives
• To create awareness among
teachers the broad scope of
classroom English.
• To suggest ways and means of
using English in the classroom.
• To impress upon the need for
speaking in English in the
classroom.
• To create an English
atmosphere in the classroom.

language: the sounds, the stress and rhythm and the intonation. When done in
combination with movements or with objects or pictures, this type of activity also
helps to establish the link between words and meaning.
Rhymes:
All children love rhymes and like to repeat them again and again. Here you can
use either traditional rhymes or modern rhymes, and you really don't have to
worry too much about the grading. Rhymes are repetitive; they have natural
rhythm and they have an element of fun, of playing with the language.
Presenting new language orally:
When children start learning English, they obviously need to be given language
before they can produce it themselves. Language has to go in before it can come
out. At this initial stage the activities will be under the control of the teacher.
Here are just some of the ways you can present new language orally:
Dialogues and role play work:
Working with dialogues is a useful way to bridge the gap between guided practise
and freer activities. Controlled dialogues can easily develop into freer work when
the pupils are ready for it. Putting pupils into pairs for doing the dialogues is a
MORE ABOUT ORAL SKILL
There are also lots of ‘listen and do’
exercises which you can do with
your children where they have to
physically move about. You can ask
pupils to do all sorts of things like :
‘hop on your left foot five times’ -
‘count up to ten and then walk to
the blackboard and back’ - and the
more language the pupils learn, the
more you can ask them to do. The
advantage with this type of activity
is that you know at once if the children
have understood. You can
check classroom vocabulary, movement
words, counting, spelling,
etc. Pupils learn from each other. If
they haven’t understood the first
time, they’ll still be able to do the
activity by watching the others
‘Listen and do' activities instructions:
The most obvious 'listen and do' activity
which we can and should make use of
from the moment we start the English
lessons is giving genuine instructions.
Most classroom language is a type of
'listen and do' activity. Communication
is two-way, and you can see very easily
if your pupils have understood the
message or not.
I. CLASSROOM ENGLISH
Classroom English is the English used
by a teacher in a classroom situation. It
certainly is a language for special
purposes which have to be learned
especially.
Let's have a look at the most interesting
and worth memorising words and
sentences a teacher may use during a
class. Let's imagine we are students
sitting in a classroom and a teacher comes in. The following are the most common
and typical classroom situations:
Greetings:
The teacher usually greets his audience and says a few words to establish contact:
Good morning.
simple way of organising even large classes.
62
How are you?
I hope you are all feeling well.
Introduction:
If the teacher is new, he will introduce himself / herself to the students.
Let me introduce myself.
I am Miss / Mr ............. .
Transition to work:
Greetings are followed by an invitation to start working:
" It's time to start now.
Absence / Lateness:
One of the first questions at the beginning of a lesson is about the students
absent: Who is absent today?
" Who is missing?
" Who isn't here?
" Who was absent Yesterday?
" Who was away last Friday?
" Why are you late?
" Where have you been?
" Did you oversleep (miss your bus)?
" I'll be unhappy if you're late again.
Blackboard Activity:
One of the most typical classroom
situations is blackboard activity:
" Come to the blackboard, please.
Go to the board.
" Come and write the word on the
board. Write it next to/above/
below that word. Take a piece of
chalk and write the sentence.
Here's a piece of chalk. Write it
on the board. Try and keep your
writing straight (level).
" Step aside, please, so that the
class can see what you have
written. Move to one side, please,
so that we can all see.
" Go and fetch some chalk from the
office. I've run out of chalk. Would
you please go and see if there's
any in the next classroom. Would
you go and look for some chalk
for me, please. Does anyone
know where the chalk is kept?
Do you know if there's any
coloured chalk?
TELL STORIES
Listening to stories should be part
of growing up for every child.
Time and time again educationalists
and psychologists have shown that
stories have a vital role to play in the
child’s development, and not least,
in the development of language.
Make sure the children get the
maximum benefit out of listening to
stories in English by the creation of
a friendly and secure atmosphere.
Establish a story-telling routine
which creates an atmosphere.
Rearrange the seating so that you
have eye contact with the children.
Have all sit together. It’s important
that children are comfortable. They
don’t have to sit up straight when
they’re listening to a story. If they’re
relaxed and comfortable, they are
more open to what they are about to
hear, and they will benefit far more
from the story-telling.
63
" That's enough for now.
" All right, you can stop now.
" You will have to stop (finish) in a
minute.
" Your time is up now, I am afraid.
Approval and encouragement:
" Excellent. That's perfectly correct.
" That's correct. You've got the idea.
" Well done. Very fine.
" You made a very good job of that.
" That's (much) (a lot) better. You
are improving. You have made a
lot of progress.
" Not quite right, try it again. You've
almost got it. You're half way
there. Have a guess if you don't
know.
" Don’t worry, your language will
improve. What if I give you a clue?
I'll help you if you get stuck.
Controlling a class:
To control a class when there is noise or lack of attention, a teacher would
usually say the following:
" Could I have your attention, please.
" Not so much noise, please.
" Silence, please.
" Get on with your work quietly.
" Don't keep turning around.
" Let us not disturb the neighbouring class.
GROUP WORK:
Quite often a teacher would ask a class to work in groups or individually:
Work (in twos, threes, etc) (in groups of two, three, etc.) (together with your
friends) (in pairs).
" Get into groups of three. Find a partner.
" Divide the class into groups.
" Here are some tasks (exercises) for you to work on in groups (pairs) (threes).
If individual work is given, the following oral instructions may be given:
" Work on your own/by yourselves / individually.
" Try to work independently.
" There is no need to discuss it with your neighbour.
" No cheating.
To stop the work when the time expires, a teacher can say:
" That will do, thank you.
USE A MASCOT
One of the most successful ways
of presenting language to young
children is through puppets or a
class mascot. Having ‘someone’
familiar constantly on hand with
whom you can have
conversations about anything and
everything is a wonderful way of
introducing new subjects and
new language to young children.
For example, if you use a Teddy
Bear as your mascot, you can
use Teddy Bear to ask
questions. Pupils can ask
through Teddy Bear: ‘Teddy
wants to know. . .’ You can
present dialogues with Teddy as
your partner”,
64
In case you feel like criticizing a pupil you can say the following: (IN PRIVATE)
That wasn't very good.
" You need to pay more attention.
" You can do better than that.
Ending a class could be signalled by the following sentences:
" It's almost time to stop.
" I'm afraid it's time to finish now.
" We'll have to stop here.
" There's the bell, so we must stop working now.
" All right! That's all for today, thank you. That will do for today. You can go
now.
Setting homework:
" This is your homework for tonight (today/next time).
" For your homework would you do exercise 10 on page 23.
" Prepare as far as (down to/up to) page 175.
" Finish this off at home.
" Do the rest of the exercise as your homework for tonight.
" You will have to read the last paragraph at home.
Saying goodbye:
" See you again on Tuesday.
" See you again tomorrow afternoon.
" Have a good holiday (Christmas) (Deepavali).
" Enjoy your holiday / summer holidays / vacation.
" I hope you all have a nice vacation.
II. TELLING STORIES
Story telling has existed for centuries. It is as old as the seas and has been
embraced by various civilizations across the world to convey information, historical
accents and entertain audiences. Stories can be magical and have the power to
awaken, transform and enthrall listeners. A good story knows no boundaries.
Everybody loves a good story.
OBJECTIVES
At the end of the session, the
trainees will be able to
! Define stories for
improving the classroom
teaching.
! Write their own stories.
! Tell stories with correct
gestures and modulation.
! Sharpen their curiosity
and to motivate them to
read further.
The art of telling stories has always
been an essential part of human
nature. Stories, metaphors, anecdotes,
similies and analogies have all been
used as methods of communication and
teaching since time immemorial.
Stories have had a potential effect on
us all over the world for thousands of
years and they continue to be part of
our culture today, in terms of helping
us to acquire knowledge and in helping
our learning and development.
65
UNDERSTANDING STORYTELLING
Story telling has been defined in many ways by many people.
Story telling is:
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN STORY
TELLING AND EDUCATION
Long before the written word, story
telling was used to pass on knowledge,
culture and thought. Storytelling,
however finds no place in the modern
methods of teaching. The all-pervasive
printed word however has left no space
for the art of storytelling in our
classrooms.
Because of this, teachers are missing
out on a great tool that can help engage
and educate children better.
Storytelling opens up a whole new
world for children. By integrating
storytelling into the curricula, both
teachers and students will be able to
communicate more intelligibly.
" A shared process which
requires a teller and a
listener.
" All about relating a tale to one
or more listeners through
voice and gestures.
" An effective medium of
communication.
" A platform for reaching out
and sharing ourselves with
others.
" A very effective teaching tool.
" A medium for children to
learn about their roots,
traditions, cultures and
values.
" The link between our
imagination and
surroundings.
QUALITIES
A storyteller requires -
! Effective communication
skills
! Patience and Endurance
! Ability to be attentive
! Good observation skills
! Good listening skills
! Good memory
! Excellent reading habit
! Compassionate outlook
! Positive attitude
! Expressive body language
! Good command over the
language and vocabulary
ELEMENTS OF A GOOD
STORY
! Characters
! A plot
! Some sort of conflict
Resolution
! Style of story telling
! Tone of your voice
! Pace of your voice
! Volume of your voice
! Non verbal communication
! Body posture
! Eye contact
! Gestures
! Involving the group
66
Turning into a Teller:
Story telling is an innate asset
which we all possess and, if tapped,
can prove to be a great tool in
teaching. There is no definite way
of telling a story. Storytelling is an
individual art and each person
develops his / her own technique and
style. However good storytellers do
share some qualities.
LISTENING SKILLS IN STORY
TELLING
The first and most important step in
becoming an effective story teller is
to understand the value of listening.
Unless we learn to silently observe
and look we will not be able to emote
sounds and characters of a story. In
short, to be an effective teller one
first needs to be a good listener of
tales.
PROCEDURE
Identifying lessons for storytelling:
 Storytelling can be used as a tool to teach all the subjects in the curriculum
such as world culture, habitats and environments, language development, Science,
Math and value based education.
TYPES OF LISTENING
! Hearing sounds without
listening to them.
! Listening to the speaker
partially. Hearing one idea and
not the rest.
! Following the speaker well
enough to find an opportunity to
express one’s own idea.
! Listening passively usually to
the same, repeated instructions,
from the teacher or the parent.
! Listening and forming
associations, word pictures, etc.
in order to remember.
! Listening critically, noticing the
emotional appeal of words.
! Appreciative and creative
listening, with genuine mental
and emotional response.
A CHECKLIST
Here is a checklist you could
use after you are ready with the
story:-
! Do you feel confident about
narrating the story to your
audience?
! Have you practised the story
aloud with timings?
! Is your voice loud, clear and
well-modulated?
! Do you believe in the story?
! Have you planned your telling
in a manner which will
innovate your audience?
! Are your story aids ready and
available for the session?
To use storytelling in the classroom,
first identify the lessons you want to
teach along with stories and decide
what concept you are going to convey
or what issue you are going to address.
Once you are clear about the concept,
you will have to find a suitable story.
Finding the story:
The best stories are the ones you are
already familiar with. To start with,
choose a short tale. Look for stories
with clear action, strong characters
and a simple structure. Of course, one
needs to pick a story that suits the
listeners.
Preparing the lesson plan:
Make a plan for narrating your story.
You can use story books and
newspapers at the school library to
create an innovative approach to
teaching through stories.
67
Preparing for the telling:
First, practise to get the story line. Once the story is clear in your mind, focus on
how you are going to tell it. Tell the story to as many people as possible during
the week to prepare for your story session. They spend this time internalizing
the critical elements of the story. While telling the story special attention must
be paid to the beginnings . The introduction can tell something about the story.
But, remember not to give away the plot. The teller needs to convey the feelings
of the characters to the audience.
PERFORMANCE SKILLS :
Remember to...
" vary the volume, pitch and tempo of your voice .
" use your face, body and gestures.
" make your body and face respond to the tale
ADVANTAGES:
! Promotes an interactive and
interesting teaching-learning
ambience.
! Helps improve the attention
span of children
! Promotes “involvement” and
“participation”
! Facilitates creativity in the
teacher.
! Kindles creative imagination in
children.
! Increases children’s willingness
to communicate.
! Encourages active participation
! Increases verbal proficiency
! Enhances listening skills
" have a clear focus and
maintain concentration
" maintain engaging eye
contact with the audience/
individual listeners
" create a charismatic
presence (make the
audience believe in you)
" use different, exaggerated
character voices
" use your space/ be dynamic
" remember to pace yourself
" always remember to regain
your style as a narrator
" use silence and pauses to
add dramatic effect.
LESSON PLAN :
The Story of the banyan tree:
The Gods decided to send Bhumi to take care of all the living creatures. She
brought banyan seeds neatly wrapped in leaves, when she landed on Earth. Soon
people were born. The men had no shelter from the scorching heat of the sun.
Bhumi took pity on them and planted the banyan seeds. They grew into slender
trees with tiny leaves. Bhumi stretched the branches and pulled at the leaves
till they came down to earth, to provide shade for men.
68
STORY TITLE THE STORY OF THE BANYAN TREE
AIM OF THE STORY To familiarize students with tropical vegetation
SUBJECT LINKS Physical geography
STORY AIDS Tree charts / story cloth
INTRODUCTION TO Do you know that the banyan tree is also known
THE TELLING as kalpakavriksha or the granting tree? There
are three images that symbolize India-the
Ganges, the Himalayas and can you guess the
third (the Banyan tree)
FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITY Project work on banyan trees-Which is the
largest banyan tree in India, what kind of soil
does it grow on? Find out about its flower, fruit,
size, etc.
PRACTICUM
Retelling folk tales in the classroom:
Relay story telling involving many students gives scope for wider play of imagination
and creativity – A story is begun and left at a crucial point for another to continue
– the other has to pause at another fork of the story.
Telling stories from pictures.
Divide classroom into 10 groups and provide each group a different composite
picture. Each group should write a few sentences about the picture and pass the
picture on to the next group along with the chart paper. The next group should
continue the story in a different colour sketch. The last group should give a
suitable end or a climax to the story.
Finding the story in songs and ballads and narrating them Teacher Educator can
circulate poems/ballads with story and ask each student to narrate the story
imbedded in the poem/ballad in prose.
Transforming students into local historians
Students can be encouraged to talk in simple English about their local heroes,
who in some way or the other have brought great good to the local community.
Following questions will help children develop/construct the local history.
" Are there any interesting stories associated to the name of the place/
streets?
" Is there any haunted house?
" Get information through the students about who founded the town and
when?
" Get old photos of the town from the district head quarters or achievers to
give scope for free discussion.
Hints :
After getting the photos and details of haunted places encourage children try
historical fiction from the point of view of a citizen who might have lived there
69
about 100/200 years ago. Include local issues which existed during that time.
Collecting family stories
By interviewing older relatives students can give true stories of their families or
those of their relatives
Puzzle Tale : Putting the pieces Together
Copy a folktale from a printed anthology and cut it up into sections or scenes.
Paste each section on a separate page. Give out the sheets to students who each
prepare to retell their small piece of the whole story. Assemble the story by
having each student keeps the flow going as the story is told so that the
performance moves along as though one person were telling it. Do a second round
by giving students different sections to retell. Notice how differently students
retell the same sections!
Plot Structure Scenarios :
Travel through the sections below and choose one or several elements from each.
Tell, write or verbally improvise a story that utilizes all the elements chosen. For
improvisational fun... put each element on a card and randomly select character,
setting, problem and solution.

70
Ask student teachers to fix a topic for the story that emerged.
After the story telling is over, we can ask students to identify values represented
in the story.
Activities
Linguistic Activities
1. Descriptive of the change from emotive, introvert into extrovert and cathartic.
Follow up activities
Ask student – teachers to recall naming words, action words, describing words
words – repeated- Repeated how many times?
sentence that made a turning print
Creativity - Ask students to think of a different end for the story.
What would you have done if you were the hero/heroine of the story ?
Prepare sentence strips from the story and also from some other text and mix
them.
Ask them to remove strips which are unrelated to the story.
III. CREATING SITUATIONS FOR DIALOGUES
A language isn’t just a ‘subject’ in the
sense of a package of knowledge. It is
not just a set of information and insights.
It is a fundamental part of being human.
There are plenty of classroom activities
which provide an extremely useful
combination of real communication and
quite deliberate rehearsal of a clearly
identified set of fairly restricted material.
They can involve any of the four skills' of
listening, speaking, reading and writing,
but their greatest contribution at primary
level is probably in the field of spoken
interaction between children.
 Trainee teachers- By working
systematically through the materials in
the book and applying them directly in
the preparation of lesson plans, in microteaching
sessions and actual
OBJECTIVES
! To make teachers aware of
some of the features of realcommunication.
! To show teachers simple
ways of getting students to
communicate with each other
in the classroom.
! To create awareness of the
importance of creating
situations for dialogues
! To make trainees create
situations
demonstration lessons, students will acquire a wide range of accurate,authentic
and idiomatic classroom phrases that will be of value throughout their teaching
careers.
Teachers in the field- It is assumed that this group will already have attained a
certain level of classroom competence, although experience suggests that there
may be recurrent inaccuracies, or even an unwillingness to use English for
classroom management purposes.
71
ORGANISING LANGUAGE
I. Teachers have to say many things simply to organize the lesson starting or
stopping an activity, getting students to do or not to do things, etc. Much of this
language consists of simple commands and instructions, which are repeated
lesson after lesson; so if the teacher says them in English, students will quickly
learn what they mean. Elicit from the student-teachers a range of simple
classroom commands in English which could be used even with elementary
students. If you like, build up a list on the board, e.g.:
Classroom Language : Simple instructions
Here are some common instructions which the class can easily understand:
" Come in.
" Go out.
" Stand up.
" Sit down.
" Come to the front of the class.
" Stand by your desks.
" Put your hands up.
" Put your hands down.
" Hold your books/pens up.
" Show me your pencil.
A number of instructions can be used at the beginning of a session
" All of you look here.
" You need pencils/rulers.
" We'll learn how to ...
" Are you ready?
" Open your books at page ...
" Look at activity five.
" Listen to this tape.
" Repeat after me.
" Again, please.
" Everybody ...
" You have five minutes to do this.
" Who's next?
" Like this, not like that.
A number of instructions can be used at the end of a session
" It's time to finish.
" Have you finished?
72
" Let's stop now.
" Stop now.
" Let's check the answers.
" Any questions?
" Collect your work please.
" Pack up your books.
" Are your desks tidy?
" Don't forget to bring your ... tomorrow.
Instructions can also be sequenced:
" First
" Next
" After that
" Then
" Finally
Language for Comprehension :
" Are you ready?
" Are you with me?
" Are you OK?
" OK so far?
" Do you get it?
" Do you understand?
" Do you follow me?
" What did you say?
" One more time, please.
" Say it again, please.
" I don't understand.
" I don't get it.
" Like this?
" Is this OK?
Using English in social contexts :
Instead of going straight to the textbook at the beginning of a lesson, the teacher
can spend a few minutes 'chatting' to the class about topics of interest. After the
very earliest stages, this can be done in English.
Give a few short demonstrations to show how this might be done.
73
The teacher can talk and ask questions, but get the students to give only
short responses, e.g.:
T : Did you all enjoy the holiday?
S : Yes.
T : Did you? Yes, I enjoyed it, too. I went on a picnic with my family. Did you go
on a picnic? Anyone?
S : Yes.
T : Who did you go with? (and so on)
The teacher can prompt individual students to talk more about things they
have done, e.g.:
T : What did you do? Did you go out?
S : Yes, I went to a party.
T : A party? That's nice. A birthday party?
S : Yes, my friend's birthday. .
can be based on topics and situations in the textbook. It builds on ideas for
organizing oral practise which were introduced in earlier units, especially:
Communicative activities.
I. Ask the teachers to look at the examples of role play activities.Demonstrate
the three activities, either act them out yourself with a colleague, or choose
good teachers to do them.
Look at these examples of role play activities.
a. One student imagines he/she is a farmer. Other students ask him/her
questions about his/her daily routine.
b. A group of students imagine they are friends planning a holiday
together. They try to decide where to go and what to do.
(i) You have a bicycle, but the tyre is flat (gesture with hands, making a ‘hissing'
noise) . . . you have a puncture . . . a puncture (give translation). So . . . you
must mend it. But first you need to know: Where is the puncture? Where's the
hole? So, what do you do? First turn the bicycle upside down (gesture, or 'draw
on the board) . . . (and so on).
T : OK, tell us. . . what
happened? What did you do
at the party? (and so on)
- The teacher can get
students to talk and ask
questions, e.g.:
T : Right. Sunil went to a
birthday party. Ask him
some questions about it.
What do you want to
know? Yes?
S1 : What did you eat?
S2 : Was it a good party?
Role play techniques can be used
with large classes and role plays
Possible topics for chatting to the
class at the beginning or end of the
lesson
! Things students did the previous day
! A piece of local news
! A local sports event e.g.:
! A football match
! A school performance
! A film on at the cinema
! An interesting TV program
! Birthday
! Other topics
74
(ii) After the demonstration, ask students how well they understood. If you have
been successful, they should have understood everything. Discuss the
techniques you used to make the explanation easier to understand.
EXPLANATIONS
Giving simple explanations
1. Most of the language we need for organizing the class consists of simple
expressions which can be used again and again - this provides an easy
opportunity to use English. However, teachers do not only need to give simple
commands and instructions to the class. Often they need to use more complex
language, for example when explaining a new word or a grammar point, or
explaining how an activity works. If the teacher can give these explanations in
English it will provide very useful listening practise for the class; but of course
the explanations must be as simple and clear as possible, so that the students
understand. Show how this can be done by giving two short demonstrations.
Demonstration
(i) Explain how to mend a bicycle tyre. Read out the explanation below, speaking
in such ways that teachers will not easily understand (uses no gestures or
drawings, and speak quickly without repeating anything):
If you have a flat tyre on your bicycle, the first thing you need to do is to find
out whereabouts the puncture is. So you turn the bicycle upside down and
remove the inner tube with a pair of tyre levers. Then you take a bucket of
water, pump up the inner tube slightly, and dip it into the water. You should
see small bubbles coming out from the puncture. You can then mark the spot
where the puncture is by making a small cross with a piece of chalk, after first
drying the inner tube.
Using English in class
After your demonstration, discuss the purpose of 'chatting' in English in
this way. Establish these points :
- It creates an opportunity for real language practise, and creates an 'English
language' atmosphere in the class.
- Even more important, it establishes contact with the class, and helps students
to feel relaxed and ready to learn. If we have a business appointment or
meet a friend, we begin by chatting to establish a friendly atmosphere; it is
just as important to do this when we meet a class of students.
Exchanging personal information
(1) One of the easiest and most interesting forms of communicative activity in
the classroom is for students to tell each other about their own lives, interests,
experiences, etc. When students talk about themselves, there is a natural
information gap', because everybody has something slightly different to say.
(2)
1.Work in pairs. Ask your partner questions 2. Communicative activities
about his or her daily routine.
Get up? School?
Breakfast? Lunch?
Evening?
Go out?
75
1. Think of another activity like this, using a grid. Choose a topic that students
would find interesting.
(ii) Divide the students into pairs. They should take it in turns to ask questions
and make brief notes in the grid. (They should make notes about their partner's
routine, not their own.)
(iii) When most pairs have finished, stop the activity. Ask a few students to tell
you what their 'partner does (e.g. 'She gets up at seven o'clock, then she has
some tea. . .').
2. After your demonstration, discuss the activity. Make these points:
- Students are genuinely communicating - finding out things from each other
that they do not know already, and which they need to know in order to complete
the grid. Completing the grid is an essential part of the activity, because it
makes the students listen to their partner's answers.
- The activity gives intensive practise of time expressions and questions and
answers using the present simple tense.
3. Divide the students into groups. Ask them to design a similar activity, using
a grid. Suggest suitable topics on
" What people like and dislike.
" What people are good/bad at doing.
" What makes people afraid. .
Guessing Games :
Tell students briefly about guessing games, and ask them to describe any game
they know themselves. Some games which are widely used in English "language
classes:
- Famous people: One student has the photo of a famous person (alive or dead)
who is known to the others. They try to guess who the person is, by asking
questions, e.g.:
Is he alive or dead? Is he a writer?
Is he an Indian? Is he a Polician?
Is he married?
Is he a freedom fighter / film star / astronomer / scientist / doctor / president?
Does he belong to Asia / Europe / UK / USA / Africa?
etc.
- What's my line?: One student chooses a job, and mimes a typical activity
which it involves. The others try to guess the job by asking questions either
about the activity or the job, e.g.:
Were you mending something?
Were you digging?
Do you work outside?
etc. .
- what and where?: The teacher sends two students out of the room. The
other students hide an object. The two students come back and guess what
the object is and where it is hidden, by asking questions, e.g.:
Is it made of wood?
Is it a pencil?
Is it on this side of the room? Is it high or low?
etc.
76
Guess the sentence
The teacher writes a sentence on a piece
of paper or card. He or she does not show
the sentence, but writes the basic
structure on the board, e.g.:
I went (somewhere) to (do something).
Students must guess the exact sentence
by asking questions, e.g.:
Did you go to school?
Did you go to the stadium?
Did you play football?
IV. LANGUAGE GAMES
AND LANGUAGE
ACTIVITIES
Language is central to the
human experience
allowing communication
with self and others and
guiding our construction of
reality. Games provide an
interesting way of learning
any language. It develops
self-confidence and skills of
reading, writing, listening
and speaking. Successful
manipulation of games in
the classroom goes a long
way in improving the
communication skills of
students. Games can be
used in many different
settings. At the classroom
level the games can be
used to reinforce and
PREPARATION OF GUIDELINES
As you prepare a game for classroom use,
follow these basic guidelines:
! Decide whether you need a game that
can be played by one student, two or
more, or by the whole class. If your
class is very large, you may select teams
or select representatives to play.
! Keep rules and scoring simple and give
each game a catchy title to arouse
interest.
! Whenever possible involve your
students in developing a new game,
preparing the needed materials, and
evolving the rules of the game.
! Plan for both types of games-Those that
depend on basic factual information and
those that deal with opinions, feelings,
and experiences with no right or wrong
answers.
OBJECTIVES
At the end of the session the
students will be able to-
! Recognize the importance of
games in the classroom.
! Use language games
successfully.
! Participate in language games.
Mime
The teacher calls a student to the front and secretly gives her a sentence written
on a piece of paper, which describes a simple activity. The student mimes the
activity. The other students try to guess the situation.
Make these points:
- In any guessing game, it is a good idea for the teacher to stand aside and let
students take over the activity
 - So it might be a useful technique for a large class.
- Guessing games can also be organized with students working in small groups.
The teacher gives a picture or a sentence to one student in each group, and
the others in the group try to guess it. The pictures or sentences can be
circulated from one group to the next, so that it will not be necessary to produce
very many copies.
77
support the teaching and learning of the language. There is no doubt that it also
develops social skills in children.
'The need for meaningfulness in language learning has been accepted for some
years. A useful interpretation of 'meaningfulness' is that the learners respond to
the content in a definite way. If they are amused, angered, intrigued or surprised
the content is clearly meaningful to them. Thus the meaning of the language
they listen to, read, speak and write will be more vividly experienced and, therefore,
better remembered.
(BBC). It was aired over the BBC many years ago and was a hit.
" Divide your students into groups. Get each group to give themselves a name.
Games can be used for review, for
presenting new information, or
simply for reinforcing important
points in your session. Like any
other method, gaming must have
a specific purpose: it must relate
in some way to the session. A game
should complement a session –
never replace it.
When to Use Games:
'Games are often used as short
warm-up activities or when there
is some time left at the end of a
lesson Games ought to be at the
heart of teaching foreign
languages. Rixon suggests that
games be used at all stages of the
lesson, provided that they are
suitable and carefully chosen.'
Just a Minute:
The first game is called "Just a
Minute" and it is adapted from a
radio game show broadcast over the
British Broadcasting Corporation
ADVANTAGES OF USING
GAMES IN THE CLASSROOM:
! Games are a welcome break from
the usual routine of the language
class.
! They are motivating and
challenging.
! Games help students to make
and sustain the effort of learning.
! Games provide language practise
in the various skills- listening,
speaking, reading and writing.
! They encourage students to
interact and communicate correct
forms.
! Language games make learners
use the language instead of
thinking about learning the
correct forms.
! Games can lower anxiety, thus
making the acquisition of input
more likely.
" The objective of each group is to
get as many points as possible.
" The task is to speak on a topic for
a minute. The referee (the
teacher) will provide the topics.
" The members of the other groupsshould
try to "wrestle" the topic
away from the person who is
speaking on it. There are three
ways to do this: By indicating a)
hesitation b) repetition and c)
deviation.
HOW TO CHOOSE GAMES?
! A game must be more than just
fun.
! A game should involve “friendly”
competition.
! A game should keep all of the
students involved and interested.
! A game should encourage
students to focus on the use of
language rather than on the
language
78
(i) Hesitation: When a student pauses for too long a break, it is considered a
hesitation.
(ii) Repetition: When a student keeps repeating a particular word or phrase, it
is considered a repetition.
(iii) Deviation: When a student digresses, he can be faulted for deviation.
A timekeeper will ring the bell once the minute is up. The person who is
speaking when the bell rings will win 10 points.
" The group with the most points is the winner.
" The teacher should determine the topics based upon the students' level of
proficiency.
This game is particularly suitable for
teaching oral communication skills. It
is also useful as a pre-writing or prereading
activity. It can be effectively
utilised when teaching topics such as
describing, narrating, expressing
viewpoints, agreeing, disagreeing, and
describing procedures.
The choice of topics would also depend
on what is being taught in the lesson
for the day. For example, if the
teacher is conducting a lesson on
describing people and places, s/he
could provide topics such as My
SOME EXAMPLES OF TOPICS
! My Childhood
! My Family
! My Favourite Things
! Ghosts
! My Ideal Partner
! Teenagers
! A Country I’d Like to Visit
! My Favourite Food
! If I Had Three Wishes, I’d Like
Mother, Someone I Admire, A Teacher I'll Never Forget, My Hometown, or My
School.
Whisper Circles
" Aim : Speaking (using a whisper), pronunciation, listening, grammar (it
takes ...to do ...)
" Notes :
(1) Divide the students into groups of 7 to 10.
(2) Choose one leader from each group. Give the leaders the card which has
the sentence "It takes about six seconds for something you drink to reach
your stomach." Ask him to memorize the sentence, go back to his group
and whisper what he has read on the card to the person on his right. Each
person will whisper the sentence to the next person and the sentence
can be said only once. The last person will say the sentence out loud. If
the sentence is the same with the one written on the card, that group
wins.
Missing Headlines
" Aim : Reading silently, reading for specific information, speaking
(discussing in pairs).
" Notes :
(1) Cut out news items and their headlines from a newspaper. Paste the
news and headlines on separate sheets of paper. Photocopy them.
79
(2) Ask students to work in pairs. Give each pair the photocopies of the news
and headlines.
(3) Ask them to match the news headlines with the news stories.
What is there in my bag today?
Elementary
Whole class, groups, and pairs to brush up vocabulary and to practise 'there's',
'there are' (or 'have you', 'have you got')
What's in my bag today? What have I got in my bag today? (This can be the
teacher's or anybody's bag).
The children guess, for instance,
There's an apple, a photograph, a mirror, handkerchief, season ticket, doll, a
sandwich, etc. and the owner of the bag says : No, there isn't a doll. Or Yes,
there's a . . . and brings it out and perhaps asks What colour is.it? Or Is it a big. ..
or a small. . . ?
There could also be pictures and models in the bag, to make the game more
interesting. There's a big plane, there's a green car, there are some sweets,
there's a man with a funny hat, etc. Models and pictures should be large enough
for everyone to see.
Task:
Group Work
1. Divide the class into five groups and have the student trainees create their
own language games. Each group has to discuss and present its game to the
class .
Individual Work
2. Refer to books in the library to identify and create new games to teach areas
like reading,writing,speaking ,listening, vocabulary building etc.
V. USE OF LANGUAGE IN SOCIAL GATHERINGS
Scope:
Use of language cannot be
confined to the four walls of
a classroom. The inner
talents of the students can
be fully measured when they
are able to use whatever they
have learned in the
classroom settings like social
gatherings.
OBJECTIVES
! To improve the communication skills
of the students in social contexts.
! To enable the students to rise to the
occasion on social gatherings.
! To make the students selfconfident.
Students get lots of opportunities to express themselves both in the campus and
out of the campus.
80
In Campus:
Literary Association:
There are opportunities galore for students to hone in their communication skills.
Literary Association meetings and various clubs like Science Club and English
Club and Red Ribbon Club are some of them where they can display their skills of
communication.
Task:
Divide the class into groups and have the students discuss AIDS Education and
the importance of Life Skills. Let the whole class involve themselves in the
discussion. Before winding up have the students present their points or view in
the form of reports.

VI. CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS
An interview is a purposeful conversation between two or more people (the
interviewer and the interviewee) where are asked by the interviewer to obtain
information from the interviewee. Interviews can be generally divided into two
types: interviews of assessment and interviews for information.
The most common type of interview for assessment is a job interview between an
employer and an applicant. The goal of such an interview is to assess a potential
employee to see if he/she has the social skills and intelligence suitable for the
workplace. Similar interviews are also used for admissions to schools, allotment
of grants, and other areas.
84
Objectives
At the end of the session the students
will be able to
" Understand how to conduct the
interview

most.
When all the students have made
their choice, put them into groups
of three, and explain that two
students in each group will play the
role of interviewers. They should
prepare questions to interview the
third student (the candidate) for the
job he / she has chosen.
The candidate should also prepare
questions as well as background
personal / career information. The
students are to be told that they can
invent any information which is relevant
and will help their job application.

86
Preliminary Work-
- It is better if the children are already familiar with the months of the year
and with the question ‘When is your birthday?’
- Set the scene in the previous maths lesson by telling the children that you
are going to conduct a survey in the English class so that you can use the
results in maths.
- At the beginning of the English lesson, remind the children that you are going
to do a survey involving Mathematical skills. (Remember that the children
will see the integration of other subjects with English in course of time)
You need an interview chart for each child, as in the example below.
Suggested procedures
- Write the first letters of the months on the board and give the class a little
repetition and accuracy practise in saying them. January February March April May June July
August
September
October
November
December

Total
Activity for children
This example shows class surveys followed by diagrammatic representation of the
results. It is simultaneously involving activity which builds on the children’s
desire to talk to each other. It also provides them with a good reason to get out of
their seats.
Language focus in this example
Months
Materials required
87
- Now remind the children of the question they will need:
Teacher : My birthday is in July. When is your birthday, Sheela.
Anna : December.
Teacher : Raghu, when is your birthday?
Paul : April.
- Draw the chart framework round the prompts.
- Interview a couple of children yourself, filling in as you go.
- Do a third, this time getting one of the children to ask the question and fill in
the answer on the board.
- Now the class is probably ready to start on their own. Issue the charts to the
class or get the children to draw their own.
- Let the children move around the room interviewing each other.
After they have finished, collect in the charts so that you do not have to rely on
the children keeping them safe until you need them in the maths lesson. In the
maths lesson, you can then show them how to draw their own chart like the one
below.
i) This is an integrating activity which you can use even if you are not a class
teacher and therefore only see the children for language lessons. There is no
reason why you should not do the follow up maths charts in your language class if
you want to, although you are in a position to coordinate what you do with the
other teachers of the same class so much the better.
ii) There is only one quick question and answer in this example so it will not take
the children very long to interview the whole class if necessary.
iii) It does not have to be a pie chart or a block graph. Why not get the children to
devise their own way of recording the information they have discovered?
88
Interview Activity for children
This activity helps children develop a sense of identity by giving them some
understanding of important past events in their lives. The activity also helps
children develop self-confidence in, speaking in front of groups.
Begin the project by discussing what an interview is with the class. Encourage
the children to watch interviews on television news shows.
INTERVIEWS
Provide a copy of the Interview sheet for each child. You might also make a large
chart with the interview questions printed on it and hang it in a place where all
the children can read it. If necessary, add drawings to help beginning readers
"read" the questions .Allow frequent opportunities for the children to interview
each other (and you!). The children might also take copies of the interview sheet
home so that they can interview family members and family members can interview
them.
INTERVIEW
Interview someone you'd like to know more about. Write the answers on this
form. Also think up three questions of your own to ask the person. Write the
questions and the person's answers on the back of the copy of form given below.
The students who come-up with different and interesting questions and thought
- provoking responses can be appreciated.

VII. TELEPHONE ENGLISH
Learning how to communicate well on the telephone is one of the top priorities for
many students who need to use English at work. Learning the common phrases
that are used on the telephone helps students know what to expect. However,
what students often need most is practise, practise, and more practise. While
helpful, practising a role-play in the classroom is not always the best way to
improve telephoning skills.
89
Telephoning requires special skills as there are a number of difficulties that
arise when telephoning that are specific to telephoning. The first and foremost
difficulty is not being able to see the person you are communicating with. This
lack of visual communication often makes students, who can communicate quite
OBJECTIVES
! To enable students to understand
telephone conversation.
! To enable students to communicate
with telephone effectively
! To enable students to make use of
telephone conversation method in the
classroom situation
successfully in other situations,
nervous and thereby hinders
their communicative abilities.
Added to this the typical hectic
pace of business
communication, and you have a
particularly difficult situation.
This feature includes a number
of ingredients to improve
telephoning skills. Included you
will find specific telephoning
phrases, telephoning techniques to improve confidence when telephoning and
telephoning practise exercises for use with your colleagues in the classroom.
Telephone role plays:
Speaking English on the telephone is difficult for learners for many reasons and
even high level students often feel uncomfortable with the unpredictability of
telephone conversations. These role cards present a series of simple situations
for pre-intermediate and intermediate level learners, working in pairs. They could
also be used for higher levels, who should be encouraged to elaborate on the
conversations and make them more natural.
These cards can be exploited as practise after looking at telephone language, as a
spontaneous speaking exercise, or as a diagnostic for you to see what your learners
need know.
Preparation
If you are using these cards for practise, you will need to have prepared your
students with some common telephone expressions
Before the class, prepare enough photocopies of the role cards for each pair of
learners to try each role-play situation - there are 10 in all.
Procedure
" Put the learners into pairs.
" If you can, organise pairs of chairs back to back. If not, ask learners to stand
back to back. This means they cannot see their partners' faces or gestures.
" Hand out pairs of role cards, e.g. 1a and 1b, to each pair. Demonstrate one
situation with two volunteers if you wish.
" Ask your learners to role-play each situation. As they finish one situation, take
the cards back and give them another. Don't worry if some pairs finish quickly
- some situations are shorter than others.
" Keep this rolling role-play going as long as you wish. Monitor and note mistakes
or interesting language for discussion afterwards.

Role Playing Suggestions
Here are some role plays for you to use in practising your telephone English.
Requesting Accommodation
Student A:
Choose a tourist spot in your country. You are going to travel to this place on an
education tour the next weekend. Telephone the school nearby for accommodation
of the students following:
" Educational tour for two days
" Accommodation for 50 boys and 50 girls
" Food and boarding
" Bus services and distance from the school
Product Information
Student A:
You need to purchase six new computers for your school. Call JA's Computer
World and ask for the following information:
" Current special offers on computers
" Computer configuration (RAM, Hard Drive, CPU)
" Guaranty
" Possibility of discount for an order of six computers
Student B:
You work at JA's Computer World. Answer student A's questions using the following
information:
" Two special offers: Multimedia Monster - with latest Pentium CPU, 256
RAM, 40 GB Hard Drive, Monitor included -Rs 20000 AND Office Taskmaster

information:
" Name and telephone number - ask student A to spell the surname
" Message student A would like to leave for Ms Reka
" How late Ms Reka can call student A at the given telephone number
Exercises for Practising Speaking on the Telephone
The most important thing about practising telephone conversations is that you
shouldn't be able to see the person you are speaking to on the phone. You may
ask, 'How can I do that if I am practising with a friend or another classmate?'
Here are a few suggestions for practising phone calls without looking at your
partner:
" If you are in the same room - Put your chairs back to back and practise
speaking on the phone, you will only hear the other person's voice which
will approximate a telephone situation.
" Use the telephone - This is pretty obvious, but really not used that often.
Give your friend a call and practise various conversations (role plays).
" Use internal office phones at work - If your class is on site (at the office) go
to different offices and call one another practising conversations. Another
variation is for the students to go into another office and have the teacher
telephone them pretending to be a native speaker in a hurry. It's then up to
the students to make sure they have communicated what they need, or
understood what the caller wants.
" Tape yourself - If you are practising alone, tape standard answers and then
practise using the tape recorder stopping and starting to simulate a
conversation.
Telephoning
Mobiles

Just One Question:
One day a scholar came to the court of Emperor Akbar and challenged Birbal to
answer his questions and thus prove that he was as clever as people said he was.
He asked Birbal, ‘Would you prefer to answer a hundred easy questions or just a
single difficult one?’ Both the emperor and Birbal had had a difficult day and
were impatient to leave.
“Ask me one difficult question”, said Birbal. “Well then, tell me.” said the man,
“Which came first into the world, the chicken or the egg?”
“The chicken”, replied Birbal.
“How do you know?” asked the scholar, a note of triumph in his voice.
“We had agreed you would ask only one question and you have already asked it,”
said Birbal, and he and the emperor walked away leaving the scholar gaping.

Scope:
It is said that a person is judged by the way he/she speaks. Skills of
communication are most necessary while carrying on a conversation. Often
between what is
said and what is
meant, there is a
gap that creates
misunderstanding.
Language is such
a powerful tool in
the hands of
individuals that
they should be
made conscious of
how best to use it.
Language is best learned through language use as an unconscious process. The
stress is on communication as a means to the mastery of the language. What we
are dealing in this unit is not ‘English for Communication’ but ‘English through
Communication’. Not “learn English so that you will be able to do and say things
later”; but “say and do things now, so that as a result you will learn English”.
(i) Listening and Speaking Skill
Generally, classroom teaching focuses on the skill of reading and writing. We
must understand that ‘Speech is Primary”. We must try to develop the skills of
listening and speaking first. These can be used to promote other language skills.
Like reading and writing, speaking practice helps consolidate what has been
learnt, besides increasing fluency.
Speaking is a productive skill that involves genuine exchange of information.
‘Listen’ means ‘to pay attention to’. Hearing is not the same thing as Listening.
Hearing is the involuntary physical
process of sensing, whereas
listening is the voluntary mental
process of perceiving. This
distinction between hearing and
listening allows you to identify
listening as a unique skill. Listening
is a receptive skill that involves
three basic stages – Learning,
Processing and Evaluating.
Be a good listener, following these
tips and become a successful
communicator. A manager used to
tell his people, “Do not listen to what
TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE LISTENING
! Assimilate and process information
! Be attentive
! Maintain eye contact
! Stay focussed
! Focus on content
! Listen completely
! Avoid emotional involvement
! Avoid distractions
GENERAL OBJECTIVES
By the end of the unit the trainee teacher will:-
! know the importance of listening
! become an efficient listener
! acquire the features of speech
! practise listening inside and outside the classroom
! get moulded as an efficient communicator
LISTENING AND SPEAKING
UNIT - 3

I am saying, listen to what I want to say”. Yes, it is not all, if you merely listen to
spoken words. You have to go beyond the spoken words and listen to the unspoken
ones and also the body language and the emotional content of the word.
(ii) Listening Tasks
The first and foremost important skill in acquiring the new and second language
is listening with understanding. For the children to get exposure to listening to
language, the teacher should speak the target language in the class. She/he has
to provide the children with plenty of listening experiences. It is unfair to expect
children to speak when the teacher does not speak fluently in the target language.
However, students could be encouraged to listen to English news bulletins in
Radio and TV to supplement classroom English.
Example Tasks
Task 1
- Listen to the sentences in order – one, two, …
- Put the correct numbers in the apt box.
Eg. 1. The boy is behind the house.
2. The ball is in front of the house.
3. The frog is on the table.
4. The squirrel is under the chair.
Continue saying sentences and let the learners fill in all the boxes with the
sentence number (Record the instructions and play in the classroom for the
children to mark. Use it as a practical work).
Task 2
Listen and Find
Something small, such as a button, is hidden in a fairly inconspicuous place. One
pupil has been outside the room, and now appears at the door to be ‘instructed’ by
the others. Each pupil gives one instruction, for instance :
- walk 6 steps forward
- now walk another 2 steps
- turn to the left
- go up to Hema’s desk
- turn to the right
- look under the desk
96
Task 3
Do it quickly
About 6 pupils face 6 others, who in turn give commands to them as quickly as
possible (each pupil should have one ready). All six obey the commands at the
same time. If one makes a mistake, he or she drops out and is replaced by the
pupil who last gave a command.
The teacher is the judge of what commands are both reasonable and in appropriate
English, but if some of them raise laughter so much the better.
Ex. Touch your nose; touch your shoes; turn round three times; shake hands
with each other; fold your arms; brush your hair, smile brightly.
Task 4
Recognition of Sounds
Listen to the tape for sound effects. First attempt to identify the sounds. Then try
to describe the sounds using words.
After listening to the sounds, the class can build up a story, which incorporates
sound effects in the order in which they have been heard, with a rich description.
Task 5
Draw what I say
Ask the children to draw a shelf and a chair. Give instructions to them to draw
pictures and to put things where they belong.
Draw
a doll / teddy bear - on the top shelf
a pair of shoes - under the shelf
a cricket bat - on the bottom shelf
a hat - on the chair
a clock - above the chair
books - on the middle shelf
Devise listening tasks with the following
characteristics.
THE ACTIVITY
! must really
demand listening.
! must not be just a
memory test.
! should be realistic
or useful in some
way.
! must actively help
children to
improve their
listening.
! should be
interesting for the
student to
participate.
! Set the task,
before listening
starts.
97
Example
Listen and respond to what the teacher says.
Scars
- Bring back to your mind the story of a scar that you have or that a close
relative of yours has.
- Tell the students your scar story. If it is about a scar of yours that is showable,
let them see it.
- Invite the group to think of how they got whatever scars they have.
- Give them a few minutes to tell his/her story.
- Help with words, and write any accident related vocabulary on the board,
(e.g.) wound, bandage, stretcher, stitches, operate. Write the words, actually
needed by the narrator.
- Ask three or four more people to tell their scar stories to the whole class and
build up further vocabulary on the board.
iii. English Speech Sounds
“There are snakes in the hole. You are welcome to eat them”.
This is the voice raised in a meeting hall. How horrified the participants were!
Later on it was realized that “There are snacks in the hall. You are welcome to
eat them”. See, how the change in a single sound brings about great difference in
meaning. Read the sentence given below.
“All chaps met my aunt on account of making cakes”.
Just pick out the words with the letter ‘a’ and read them.
all : / /
chaps : /æ/
aunt : /a:/
account : / /
making : /ei/
cakes : /ei/
Have you found different sounds produced by the letter ‘a’ ?
See, one letter produces different sounds. Read the words given below.
fear, photo, laugh
Have you noticed that the same sound is produced by different letters?
Do we pronounce the underlined letters ?
palm dumb
There are silent letters in English.
So what do we arrive at now ?
There is no one to one correspondence between the spelling and pronunciation.
In Tamil the knowledge of alphabet alone is enough to read. But in English, it
demands the knowledge of sounds too.
The reason is 26 letters represent 44 sounds.
Such interesting specialties motivate us to have a clear idea about the sound
system in English.

Vowel Chart
The organs of Speech
How do we speak ? By producing sounds that make up words.
How do we produce sounds ? We don’t know. But why should we know ? In order
to learn, teach and use a language effectively and purposefully, a basic knowledge
of technical aspects such as how, when and where a sound is produced is essential.
To know these things, we must have some idea of the organs of speech.
The organs helpful in the production of speech are called organs of speech.
How does a flutist produce music on his flute ? He blows out the air through the
blowhole and this air is modified by stopping and opening the other holes on his
flute by his fingers. Sweet music is produced. This is true with the speech sounds
too. How ?
The stream of air that comes out of the lungs through the trachea (wind-pipe) to
the mouth, is modified on its way by some of the organs of our body like the nose,
lips, teeth, tongue, etc.
Now let us practise the sounds through interesting tasks.

3 Consonant sounds
m n η hl r wj
These are symbols that help you to identify and produce the sounds properly.
Using a pencil, just tick the symbols that are familiar to you.
Completed ? 2 in vowel sounds and 17 in consonant sounds. You are exactly
correct. The 19 letters in English alphabet are used as symbols. The obvious
difference is all the 44 symbols are written within slashes.
Example. /I/, /e/, /p/, /b/
Task 2
Write all the 44 symbols within slashes.
Symbols that are similar to the letters are not written in capitals.
Symbols can’t be joined as we write letters. They should be written apart.
CONSONANT SOUNDS
There are 24 consonant sounds in English represented by 21 consonant letters.
The consonants in English include plosives, fricatives, affricates, lateral, a
frictionless continuant, nasals and semi-vowels according to the place and manner
of articulation.
Plosives
Table – 1
Plosive Initial Position Medial Position Final Position
/p/ pit apple tip
/b/ bit rabbit lab
/t/ talk butter feet
/d/ dull bladder glad
/k/ kit rocket duck
/g/ give ago mug
First listen, and then repeat after the teacher, what is given in the table.
Example : /p/ as in pit, apple and tip
Can you feel the main organs involved in producing these sounds?
/p/ and /b/ - lips
/t/ and /d/ - tongue and teeth ridge
/k/ and /g/ - back of the tongue and soft palate
e
e c: e c e

Have you heard the exploding noise, while producing these 6 sounds ?
Fricatives
Latin ‘fricare’ means ‘rub’.
Table – 2
Fricative Initial Position Medial Position Final Position
/f/ feel differ stuff
/v/ vain liver grave
/θ/ think method cloth
/ð/ the father clothe
/s/ sit possible gas
/z/ zip razor rose
/
∫
/ shoe assure dash
/3/ - leisure garage
/h/ hot ahead -
First listen and then repeat after the teacher, what is given in table – 2.
Example : /f/ as in feel, differ and stuff.
Task 3
Pronounce each sound and prolong it as /f/……/v/……
Can you continue successfully ?
Find how ?
Produce each sound, keeping your finger along your lips. What happens? Can you
feel air passing through, with audible friction ? Yes.
Can you feel the obvious position of organs that produce friction?
/f/ and /v/ - lower lip and upper teeth
/θ/ and /ð/ - tip of the tongue between upper and lower teeth
/s/ and /z/ - tip of the tongue in gentle contact with alveolar ridge
/
∫
/ and /3/ - the tip, the blade and the front of the tongue raised
towards the hard palate
/h/ - produced at the glottis (Sound of pure breath)
These fricatives are continuants, whereas plosives are not.
101
Practise the pairs
ferry - very sink - zinc
fan - van seal - zeal
fine - vine sip - zip
farce - vase bus - buzz
In these 9 sounds,
/3/ is a rare sound even in English. It never occurs in initial position and /h/
never occurs in final position.
Say the following words :
What
When
Where Is ‘h’ pronounced?
Why
Refer to the Dictionary and find whether ‘h’ is pronounced in the following
words. exhibit, exhaust, vehicle, hour, honest, honour.
Affricates
Table – 3
Affricate Initial Position Medial Position Final Position
/t
∫
/ cheap puncture beach
/d3/ jeep largest ridge
Listen and repeat the words after the teacher.
Can you feel 2 sounds in one symbol ?
A plosive is gliding towards a fricative.
Task 4
Say aloud substituting /
t∫
/ with /d3/. Write the words too.
chain - jane batch -
choke - etching -
chin - riches -
As they combine the qualities of plosives and fricatives, they are called Consonantal
Diphthongs.
102
Lateral : Table – 4
Lateral Initial Position Medial Position Final Position
/l/ lamp volley ball fill
Task 5
Say 5 sets of words each with the sound /l/, at initial, medial and final position.
Refer to the dictionary and find the phonetic script for the following words.
palm, calm, realm, balm, psalm, film.
What have you found ?
Nasals
Table – 5
Nasal Initial Position Medial Position Final Position
/m/ mat rumour palm
/n/ net any thin
/η/ - singer sing
Listen to and repeat the words after your teacher.
Is your nose involved in producing these 3 sounds ?
/η/ - never occurs in the initial position.
Task - 6
Pronounce and underline the letters that give the corresponding sound.
/m/ - man, summer
/n/ - sun, banner
/η/ - sing, zinc, thank, anxious
Semi Vowels
Table – 6
Semi Vowel Initial Position Medial Position Final Position
/j/ yell fuse -
/w/ well power -
/r/ roam carriage -
Listen to and repeat after your teacher.
Have you noticed the last column in the table ? These 3 sounds never occur in
the final position at all.
103
Read these words aloud :
purse fracture
earn tractor
world ration
hard distraction
mark grumble
Silent ‘r’ Pronounced ‘r’
“Our teacher asked us to sit in the rear end of the cabin”.
 (S) (P) (P)
Task 7
Now we are familiar with 24 consonant sounds. Pronounce each sound , putting
your fingers on your throat or closing your ears with your fingers or keeping your
palm over your head.
For example : take /k/ and /g/
Pronounce /k/ - closing your ears – you won’t feel vibration.
Pronounce /g/ - closing your ears – you’ll feel vibration.
So, /k/ is voiceless and /g/ is voiced.
Make a table of 24 sounds and record your findings as below.
Sounds Voiced Voiceless
/k/ #
/g/ #
Till now we have seen the consonant sounds that occupy the marginal positions.
The knowledge of consonants alone is not enough to read the sounds. Consonants
and vowels together make words. So, let us learn the vowel sounds and try to
transcribe words.
VOWEL SOUNDS : Vowels are sounds produced without any obstruction anywhere
in the vocal tract, whereas Consonants are produced with obstruction somewhere
in the vocal tract.
104
Monophthongs
Out of 20 vowel sounds 12 are monophthongs or pure vowels. In these 7 are
similar to the vowel sounds in Tamil. The other five are different.
Let us pronounce and transcribe, with the help of a Pronunciation Dictionary.
1. /Λ/ - as in cut, cup, come, son, bun
If we take ‘son’, the first consonant sound is /s/, the last sound is /n/. The
middle one /Λ/. Put together it is /sΛn/.
Pronounce and transcribe using the right consonants.
bun - / /
blood - / /
young - / /
does - / /
ton - / /
2. /a:/ as in art, park, arm, farm.
Pronounce and transcribe the following words.
pass -
mark -
clerk -
laugh -
3. /I/ as in ink, lip, nib, pin
Write the symbols for the sounds.
sin -

These words are uttered at one breath, isn’t it ? Yes.
English allows 3 consonants to begin a syllable and upto 4 consonants to end a
syllable. Such a sequence of consonants at the beginning or end of a syllable
is called consonant cluster.
Consonant clusters refer to a group of consonant sounds but not letters.
Example :
‘sl’ is a consonant cluster because the letters ‘s’ and ‘l’ introduce two different
sounds.
sleep - cluster in the beginning
ink - cluster in the end
On the other hand ‘sh’ is not a consonant cluster because the two letters
namely ‘s’ and ‘h’ produce one single sound and not two sounds. Similarly ‘ch’
is not a cluster but ‘cr’ is a cluster.

Word Stress
Take your dictionary and find the pronunciation for the word ‘examination’.

 1 2345
Can you find spaces in between the symbols ? See whether there are any
vertical bars ? Do you know what it means ? Let us learn.
In each word, not all syllables are equally stressed. A particular syllable is
pronounced louder than the other syllables in the word. This is to maintain the
rhythm of spoken language. That syllable is called prominent syllable. The
prominent syllable is said to receive stress and hence it is the stressed syllable
in a word.
In words with more than 3 syllables, there can be more than one prominent
syllable. In that case, the most prominent syllable receives primary stress and
the next prominent, the secondary stress.
In the example given above the 4th syllable receives primary stress and the 2nd
syllable receives secondary stress.
115
Say the words with the stress on the correct syllable.
e'state - Is'teIt
ba'lloon - b 'lu:n
de'sign - dI'zaIn
enter'tain - ent 'teIn
en'counter - Iη'kaUnt
de'termine - dI't3:mIn
instru'mental - InstrU'mentl
Not only clear pronunciation of sounds but also uttering the word with stress in
the appropriate position is necessary for intelligibility. Stress changes the category
and meaning of the word sometimes.
1. Read the following words stressing appropriately.
'conduct - con'duct
'object - ob'ject
'permit - per'mit
'produce - pro'duce
'record - re'cord
See, spellings are the same. But stress varies. What does it mean ?
Stress changes the usage of words. ‘A’ Group is noun group and ‘B’ verbs.
If the word is used as a noun, stress is on the first syllable.
If the word is used as a verb, stress is on the second syllable.
Wrong stress changes one word into another.

Task 4
There are a variety of ways of marking stress in a written text. Which of the
following do you personally find clearest ?

Sentence Stress
Read the phrases / sentences stressing accordingly.
He 'wanted a ru'pee.
'Half an 'hour.
'Turn to the 'left at the 'end of the 'road.
That’s 'not where I 'wanted to 'go.
Is it not rhythmic as the stressed and unstressed syllables occur at equal
intervals?
In actual speech, words are not just uttered one after another. There are
utterances made up of one word and there are also utterances made up of
several words. This is called ‘Connected Speech’.
Connected speech in English is rhythmic. This rhythm is the result of sentence
stress. In a sentence all the words are not stressed. Usually the content words
such as nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are stressed. The form words like
prepositions, conjunctions, articles, auxiliary verbs are normally not stressed.
While saying a sentence, the speaker puts the stress on different words in
order to show their importance in relation to the other words in a sentence.
Since the number of possible sentences can be said in different ways to convey
various shades of meaning, it is not possible to formulate any rules to indicate
the incidence of stress on the different words in a sentence. But even so,
sentences can be broadly divided into 2 major kinds on the basis of their stress
patterns. One kind may be called normal or UNEMPHATIC and the other
contrastive or EMPHATIC.
In a normal or unemphatic sentence all the meaningful words are equally
important to the speaker and hence they are all almost equally stressed, while
the structural words usually go unstressed.
e.g.
In the sentence “I 'think he 'wants us to 'go”, the three meaningful words as
shown will be stressed when no special emphasis or contrast is intended.
But in exceptional circumstances, the meaningful words may lose their stress
117
and even the structural words may be stressed. Such circumstances arise
when the speaker wants to put special emphasis on a particular word or wants
to contrast it with something else. In such cases any word may be stressed
heavily depending upon the emphasis or the contrast intended.
e.g.
'I think he wants us to go (You may not think so)
I 'think he wants us to go (I am not sure)
I think 'he wants us to go (Not the others), etc.
The sentences containing such heavily stressed words are called emphatic
sentences.
These sentences are usually charged with a high degree of emotional content
and the stress on the contrastive word is the shade heavier than the normal
primary stress. In a highly emotional utterance this becomes so heavy that all
other syllables lose their stress. This stress in speech is equivalent to
underlining, italicising or printing in bold type in writing.
Unstressed words tend to be pronounced quite fast, almost as if trying to cram
themselves into the spaces between the beats of the rhythm. They also tend to
be pronounced in a ‘weak’ manner; they typically use shorter vowel sounds
: / / rather than /u:/; /I/ rather than /i:/, etc. This use of weak forms is one
of the features of connected speech. The most common weak form vowel sound
is / / - the schwa.
Task 6
At random, choose a sentence from anywhere in this book. Mark every schwa
in it.
Task 7
Consider the effect that changing stress has on the meaning of a single sentence.
Finish the explanatory notes in the same way as the first example.
Michael wanted to buy the red shirt ( not anybody else )
Michael wanted to buy the red shirt ( )
Michael wanted to buy the red shirt ( )
Michael wanted to buy the red shirt ( )
Michael wanted to buy the red shirt ( )
Intonation
Now let us turn to another aspect of connected speech. Stress does play a significant
role in English speech, but stress is not everything. What actually gives life to
English speech is a happy blend of ‘stress and intonation’. Thus stress and
intonation always go together and the one without the other is not of much
significance. Have you heard an English man or American speak either on TV or
radio? You might have noticed the variations in voice rise, fall or same level.
This movement is either upwards (a rise) or downwards (a fall) or flat. Intonation
has a definite effect on meaning and also gives us information about the speakers’
e
e
118
attitude. In English speech what we say does not matter half so much as how we
say it. Context and the mood of the speaker alone can give a clue to the intonation
and its meaning. Even then, for our practical purposes, we can identify 4 basic
patterns.
The most common patterns are :
1. Falling intonation (Falling tone)
2. Raising intonation (Rising tone)
3. Falling-rising intonation
4. Rising-falling intonation
The rise and fall of the tone/voice is indicated by some arrow marks called
tonal marks.
Falling Tone
This indicates a falling tone. The voice starts high and ends low. This sign
is marked downwards from above and over to the stressed syllable of the key word
or phrase in a sentence.
1. Normally, statements which are complete and definite are spoken with a
falling tone.
God made MAN.
The children are playing CHESS.
2. ‘Wh’ questions
What’s the TIME ?
Where do you LIVE ?
3. Commands
Shut the DOOR.
Come QUICKly.
4. Exclamatory sentences
Good HEAvens ! (A pleasant surprise)
What a lovely FLOWer ! (A sense of appreciation)
NONsense ! (A sense of invitation)
119
Rising Tone
1. If a statement is intended as a question, a rising tone is used.
You came this MORning ? (I thought you came yesterday evening)
He died so SOON ? (A sense of surprise)
2. If the statement is intended to be soothing or encouraging.
I will HELP you. (So don’t worry)
I hope you will PASS. (So don’t worry)
3. If one wants to show as much interest in the other person as in the subject,
then the wh- question is asked in a rising tone.
What’s your NAME ?
How is your DAUGHter ?
4. Yes / No questions.
Can I SEE it ?
Have you finished your WORK ?
5. If the exclamations are spoken as questions.
OH ? (Is it so ?)
REAlly ? (I thought otherwise)
WHAT ? (Can it be true ?)
6. Greetings and wishes.
Good MORNing.
HeLLO.
Happy CHRISTmas.
7. Rhetorical questions that are merely asked for the sake of emphasis or for
creating a certain effect are spoken in a rising tone.
Can the blind lead the BLIND ?
Who can escape DEATH ?
120
8. Apostrophes (i.e. addresses to a person – often dead and absent or to a thing
– often personified) are made in a rising tone.
FRAILty, thy name is woman.
DEATH, where is thy sting ?
Falling – Rising Intonation
1. In tag question (i.e. questions that are asked for confirmation / approval,
etc.) we generally use a falling tone at the end of the I part and a rising tone
at the beginning of the second.
You’re learning FRENCH, AREN’T you ?
Let’s have some MUSIC, SHALL we ?
2. When there is a contrast drawn in a sentence, that which is contrasted is
spoken with a rising tone and the other in a falling tone.
I want to buy a TELevision set, not a RADio.
My brother is a DOCtor, not an engiNEER.
Rising – Falling Intonation
1. When there is enumeration of things in a sentence, i.e. things mentioned in
succession are spoken with a rising tone followed by falling tone in the end.
I CAME, I SAW, I CONQUERED
We’re going to FRANCE, ENGland, ROME and then to SWITzerland.
Task 8
Add the words fall or rise to the following guidelines.
a. Wh- questions - fall
b. Yes/No questions - rise
c. Enumeration of things - …………
d. Greetings and wishes - …………
e. Rhetorical questions - …………
f. Commands - …………

To learn more about intonation and practise different tones, you need either to
watch English channels on television or listen to radio.
Paralinguistic Features
Mastering the Sounds, Stress and Intonation is not enough to be an effective
speaker. The speech of an effective speaker has other qualities, which can be
described as paralinguistic features. Paralinguistic features include voice quality,
clarity, volume, pace and pauses.
Voice Quality
When we hear some voice over the telephone, we immediately recognize whose
voice it is. How is this possible? This is possible because each person’s voice has a
particular quality. We would all like to have our voices sweet, melodious, warm,
pleasant and so on. But not everyone is gifted with these qualities. Does it make
any difference, if we do not possess these qualities ? We should not forget that
the voice quality could draw and retain the attention of the audience or drive
away the audience from listening.
Can we change our voice quality? We have heard many artists mimicking voices
of politicians, cine artists, etc. That means we can change voice quality. But
sustaining the quality for a long time is difficult. Therefore it is better to speak
naturally with whatever voice quality we have.
Tips to maintain voice quality:
- give up the habit of overstraining your vocal cords
- sip water frequently, when you face with the problem of dry and hoarse
throat
Task 10
Mimic one of your friends; let your classmates find who she/he is.
Clarity
Clarity is another aspect of a good speech. An effective speaker has clarity not
only in thoughts and language but also in voice. In order to be clear, we shall
remember the following.
a. The words have to be pronounced clearly.
b. The sounds / words should not be swallowed.
c. The lip movement should be distinct.
Pace and Pauses
We come across a few people who prepare their lectures well in advance. But
when they actually speak in the classroom, they rush through the material and
finish the lecture early. Even the listeners would not comprehend what the speaker
is saying in such a situation. How can we overcome this defect?
We should learn to speak at a pace, which suits the listeners. Adjusting the
speed according to the need of our audience is a difficult task. But we can do it
easily if we know who our listeners are. Are we talking to school children,
illiterates or educated adults ? Those who do not have a good knowledge of
background information and language (like children and illiterates) need a slower
pace of speaking.
122
Besides slowing down the pace of our speech, we need to peruse better words and
better ideas. Pausing in between words and ideas is a very effective means of
holding listeners' attention. Pausing gives the speakers time to think, choose a
right phrase and know the audience. The listener needs time to follow our words.
So, by pausing, when we move from one point to another, we make it easy for the
listener to follow us.
Practice Activity
1. Take any paragraph of about 10 lines from Std V course book. Read it aloud
several times varying volume, speed and voice quality.
2. Imagine that you are speaking to a class of about 40 children. Record your
speech on any topic for 5 minutes. Listen to the recording and analyse for
the following features. Volume, voice quality, pauses and clarity of language.
3. Listen to any 2 newsreaders of English and evaluate their speech in terms
of paralinguistic features.
4. Listen to an English newsreader and a regional language newsreader.
Compare and contrast the 2 readers in terms of voice quality and voice
modulation.
5. Prepare a speech for 2 minutes and present it in your classroom. Discuss
and improve yourself.
V. Developing Communication Skills through Specific Tasks
Communication comes from the Latin word ‘communis’ which means ‘common’.
When we communicate, we try to establish ‘commonness’ with others.
We all need to communicate, wherever we are and whatever we do. The inability
to communicate appropriately and successfully leads to failure in our personal
and professional lives. If one knows the art of communication, he/she can easily
avoid a lot of miscommunication, waste of time, energy and money. Effective
learning and teaching, better parent-child understanding and better interpersonal
relations are some of the benefits of effective communiction.
So what are we waiting for, Let’s begin !!!
Are you surprised ? One who learns driving, takes the seat first and adds to his
learning. Similarly one who indulges in English communication should speak
first and then add more and more.
I.
Though you may not find enough words to express yourself, make full use of
gestures… then step by step add on words.

 by the teachers - Press them to give a tip daily
- Lack of interest - Self interest. Your motto is to
 SHINE
- Fear - Nobody can be a master of a foreign
 language. Everyone is a learner
- Insufficient vocabulary - Acquire vocabulary through
 listening and reading

A B
132
4. Asking questions. (For practicum)
Asking the Explorers
Send a small group of children, no more than five or six, to study some specific
object or place near the school or even inside the school building. For example,
they may be sent to examine a cluster of trees, a tea-stall, a broken bridge or a
nest. Ask them to explore it carefully and discuss among themselves everything
they notice.
While the explorer group is away, the teacher tells complete details about the
place / object they were exploring, to the children inside the classroom. When
the explorer group comes back, it will face questions from the class. The teacher
can also have her turn.
Guess what I saw
One child goes out and selects one of the hundred things she sees around (it
could be anything – tree, leaf, bird, squirrel, bird, wires, grass). When she comes
back, she says just one sentence about the thing she has in mind.
For example – She might say, “What I saw is brown”.
Now every child in the class gets one chance to ask more about the thing and
guess what it was.
Finally when the thing has been guessed correctly, some children may object to
the answers they got for their questions. For instance, someone may point out
that the colour was not brown but clay like. In such situations, the teacher’s role
is very important.
5. Making a Story
Collect odd things like lids, torn pieces of cloth, broken bangles, empty toothpaste
tubes, little stones, leaves, nibs, etc. Make piles of 5 or 6 items, and distribute
the piles among groups of five of six children. Each group finds a suitable place to
sit down and talk about the things in the pile. The aim is to prepare a story in 15
or 20 minutes. When all groups return to the classroom, one narrator in each
group tells the story. Allow variations.
Summing up
In this unit, we have discussed the listening and speaking skills. Listening is the
skill that is central to life. Listening tasks are given to practise and sharpen our
listening skills. The production of speech sounds, stress and intonation patterns,
maintenance of clarity, pace and pause moulds us to speak with clarity and
intelligibility. Next we discussed the importance of communication in our life. We
have started speaking in simple English with appropriate gestures. We have aimed
at effective communication, even with a few expressions. Then we have moved
ahead with the help of a guide, peers, library books and above all with a firm
decision to communicate in English. We have experienced the role of ‘personal
interest’ in achieving our goal.

UNIT - 4
METHODS AND APPROACHES OF TEACHING ENGLISH
Scope:
The history of language teaching presents a fascinating variety of methods. If
there is such a variety of
methods, which one are we
to choose? There is no
definite answer to this
question; What works with
one learner may not work
with another. Again,
different methods may be
appropriate to different
contexts. If we start
searching for the perfect
method or the ideal single
solution to the problems of
language learning, we are
bound to fail.
What can we do as teachers,
then? We should be aware
of the various approaches but
ultimately, teachers need to
use their discretion in
deciding on what method to
use and when. Any method
that works, is good. The
objectives of teaching
OBJECTIVES
At the end of this unit, you will be able
to
1. distinguish the notions of approach,
method and procedure.
2. understand the rationale and the salient
features of
a. the Grammar – Translation Method
b. the Direct Method
c. the Bilingual Method
d. the S- O – S Method
3. critically evaluate the above methods and
approaches to ELT.
4. become familiar with current trends in ELT.

(CLT)
ii) Activity Based Learning (ABL)
iii) Active Learning Method (ALM)
English as Second language (ESL) must be achieved. All the choices that are
made must ensure that the learner achieves second language competence. In
this unit, then, we shall look at various approaches to language learning in the
history of English Language Teaching (ELT).
The way a child acquires the ability to speak her / his mother tongue by the age
of five, is one of the marvels of creation. Many children learn several languages
at a very young age, whereas some learners fail to acquire even basic English
after twelve years of schooling. How do children acquire their first language? Do
they learn their mother tongue through imitation of the parents or do they simply
acquire it as when their innate capacity for learning unfurls as naturally as fish
learn to swim or song birds learn to sing? Do they learn a second language at the
same speed as they do their mother tongue? What is the difference between first
language acquisition and second language learning? What are the major factors
affecting second language learning?
136
Observations on Acquisition and learning of a language :
! Acquisition is the act of getting something especially knowledge, skill
etc, by your own efforts, ability or behaviour.
! Learning is gaining knowledge or skill by studying, from experience,
from being taught etc.
! Language acquisition is the process by which the language capability
develops in a human.
! It is the process by which a child acquires its mother tongue.
! It is the most wonderful feat we perform in our whole life and we do it at
an age when we can hardly do anything else.
! It is an active process by which children, taking cues available to them,
construct their own utterances and say things they have never heard of.
! Language learning is a behaviour acquired by making conscious efforts.
! It involves certain skills – learning to understand when it is spoken,
speaking, reading and writing.
! It is also forming a certain set of habits.
! It is acquired by imitation and practice.
! Since language is a learned activity, we have to learn it and teach it
properly.
Distinction between acquisition and learning
There are many distinctions between the processes of acquisition and learning.
! Children within 5 years of age learn their mother tongue through acquisition.
A second language, L2, is through conscious effort of learning.
! Acquisition is an unconscious process where no formal classroom instruction
is involved. Learning, however is about conscious knowledge and the
application of rules and structures.
! In language acquisition, the focus is on communication or reception of a
message. But in language learning the thrust is on syntax and grammar.
! The context is usually crucial and meaningful in language acquisition but
it need not be important to that extent in language learning.
! Motivation is a matter of urgent necessity for acquisition. It is not so for
learning L2.
! Most importantly, the usual outcome of language acquisition is fluency which
is by no means guaranteed in language learning.
How can English be learnt as a second language?
Krashan (1985), in his theory of second language acquisition (SLA) suggested
that learners have two different ways of developing competence in a second
language:
First Language Acquisition
As teachers, learners and researchers in a second language, namely, English,
why should we look at first language acquisition at all? There are similarities
137
as well as differences between first language acquisition and second language
learning. Still, we could learn a lot about language learning by observing children
acquiring their mother tongue by the age of three or four. They enjoy learning
and feel no strain at all. How do they manage this miracle? Could we borrow
their strategies for teaching English to our learners? Researchers claim that
L2 teaching methods recapitulate L1 acquisition, and that learning L2
reactivates the process by which L1 was learnt.
 Acquisition and learning.
Acquisition is a subconscious process children utilize in acquiring their first
language and learning is a conscious process that results in knowing about the
rules of language.
! Jim Cummis’ Inter dependence hypothesis says students without a firm
foundation in their native language will face difficulty in mastering the
second language.
! The learning of mother-tongue is acquired by the children through a natural
process. This natural process should be adopted in learning English as
second language.
! In the early stages,
i. Due attention should be paid to correct pronunciation and accent.
ii. Formation of speech habits should be paramount.
iii. Loud reading should be given precedence over silent reading.
iv. Teaching of formal grammar should be avoided or postponed to a
later stage.
v. Words relating to the every-day life of children should be taught.
vi. Create exposure to language so that learners have more opportunities
for communication
vii. Create an informal atmosphere as against the formal atmosphere of
an L2 classroom.
viii. Build up efforts for genuine, real-life communication.
ix. Encourage learners to focus on the meaning or message, not on
form.
x. Adopt a tolerant attitude to errors, if correction is needed, do it
incidentally.
Summary
In this unit, we have looked at the various explanations on language acquisition
of the child’s mother tongue and second language learning. We then examined
the difference between first language acquisition and second language learning.
We also learnt that how the conducive factors and strategies that facilitated L1
acquisition could be adopted for L2 learning.
Evaluation
Given below are some views on a few major issues in ESL. Say whether you agree
or disagree with them. Give reasons for each of your answers.
138
SNo Views Yes No undecided
1. Acquisition is gradual development of
ability in a language by using it
naturally in situations.
2. Learning is a conscious process of
accumulating knowledge of the
vocabulary and grammar of a language
3. Mother tongue is acquired by
imitation and practice.
4. The earlier a second language is
introduced in a school programme,
the greater is the likelihood of
success in learning it.
5. Most of the mistakes which second
language learners make are due to
interference from their first
language.
6. Children are biologically programmed
for language learning. Whatever may
be the efforts, language acquisition
occurs at a predictable age.
7. We can acquire a good fluency in a
second language at any age so long
as we are interested.
8. Children who have educated parents
learn language better than those who
are first-generation learners.
Exploration
Mother tongue acquisition is natural, spontaneous and is being supported by various
conducive factors prevailing at home, society, friends, etc. even before a child
joins a school. How can these supporting agents be thought of being provided to
the child while learning English?
Task: 1 Discuss this topic with your teachers or language experts at
your locality.
Task: 2 What do you think of the hurdles that slow the process of
second language acquisition among our primary school
children in Tamil Nadu, especially at rural settings.
139
Task: 3 Discussion:
Observe children acquiring their mother tongue and learning
English language. Are there any differences between acquisition
of L1 and L2 (English)?
Task: 4 One of the major problems of learning a second language is the
problem of overcoming the pull of the mother – tongue. The best
way to deal with this problem is to concentrate the efforts on
the sounds and the structures in which the difference between
the two languages is the greatest. To help the learner in this
task, the teacher will have to find out these ‘trouble spots’ and
devise suitable strategies to deal with them. Identify some trouble
spots’ among the learners of class I English and suggest some
strategies to deal with them.
What does ‘method’ refer to?
Method refers to the overall plan for
the orderly presentations of language
material based on selected approach
and procedure. A method includes
three components:
! Approach
! Design
! Procedure
- Approach is concerned with the
theory of the nature of language and
language learning.
- Design concerns itself with:
! The general and specific objective
of the course.
! A syllabus model
! Types of learning and learning
tasks
! Roles of learners and teachers
! Role of learning materials
- Procedure is concerned with:
! The actual happening in the class
room
! Class room techniques, practices
and behaviours.
The Grammar – Translation Method:
! If we look into the history of
language teaching, We find that
no one method seems to have
POINTS TO PONDER
• Given below are a number
of various points on the
nature of language and
language learning.
• Which of them reflects the
way you learnt English?
• Language is a set of words
and a set of rules. English
is learnt by learning the
words and mastering the
rules of grammar.
• Language is a set of
structures. Sounds are
structured into words,
words are structured into
sentences and sentences
into paragraphs.
• Language consists of a set
of functions: greetings,
requesting, complaining,
suggesting etc.
• Language involves
interaction with people
either through the oral or
written medium.
140
prevailed for long. Different language teachers believe in different ways of
teaching. It may therefore be said that there are as many methods of
language teaching, as there are language teachers.
! Around the year 1840, an attempt was made to replace these individual
methods by a single method as the Grammar – Translation Method. This
was the brainchild of German Scholars like Johann Seidenstucker, Karl
Plotaz, H.S. Ollendorf and Johann Meidinger, whose principal aim was to
make language learning easier.
Critical Evaluation:
Grammar – Translation Method dominated foreign language teaching for over a
century 1840 to 1940 – and is still present in one form or the other in many
parts of the world.
With increased opportunities for communication that demanded oral proficiency
KEY FEATURES:
" It is a way of studying a language that
approaches the language first through
detailed analysis of its grammar rules,
followed by application of this
knowledge to the task of translating
sentences and texts into and out of the
target language.
" Reading and writing are the major focus.
Little attention is paid to speaking and
writing.
" Vocabulary selection is based solely on
the reading texts used, and words are
taught through bilingual word lists,
dictionary study and memorization.
" The grammar rules are presented and
illustrated. A list of vocabulary items is
presented with their translation
equivalents. Translation exercises are
prescribed.
" The sentence is the basic unit of teaching
and language practice.
" Grammar is taught inductively.
" The student’s native language is the
medium of instruction
the GTM was questioned
and rejected as an
effective method of
teaching a foreign
language.
1. Students found the
method frustrating as
they had to memorize
words and rules.
2. The use of L1 in the
Class room prevented
the learner from
developing confidence
to communicate in
English.
3. The learners found it
very difficult to free
themselves from the
liberal use of the
mother – tongue.
4. As the language of
literature is quite
different from the
language of everyday
communication, the
learner was unable to
use English in day-today
communication.
5. This was further
aggravated by the fact
that the method
focused on written,
rather than oral
language.
141
6. The excessive obsession with accuracy and completeness inhibited learner’s
communication.
In spite of the strong criticism against this method, it has some strong following
among teachers and learners across the globe.
! Translation is a cross-lingual technique which is used in language learning.
! Grammar teaching is given importance. Learners understand the
grammatical system of the second language.
! Translation exercises put the learner into an active problem – solving
situation.
! In our schools and teaching situations teachers still resort to translation
technique as an easy way of explaining things.
Discussion
Eminent Indian leaders have attained remarkable mastery over the English
language after learning it through the Grammar Translation Method. How
could it have been possible if the method has many drawbacks as listed
above?
Practical application:
In order to fully understand how Grammar – Translation Method works in the
class, let us try to understand it by following the steps that the teacher has to
take.
Step 1
! The teacher chooses a reading passage from the English text book.
! He asks each student to read a few lines from it and translate them into
his mother – tongue (L1)
! He helps him with new vocabulary items.
Step 2
! When they have finished reading and translating the passage, the teacher
asks them in L1 if they have any questions.
! He answer the questions in L1.
! This actively goes on till the teacher feels that all the questions have been
answered.
Step 3
! The teacher asks the students to write answers to the questions given at
the end of the passage.
Step 4
! After one – half hour, the teacher speaking in L1, asks the students to
check their answers.
! One by one the students read their questions and answers.
! If the answer is correct, the teacher approves. If incorrect, he gives the
correct answer.
142
Step 5
! As the next activity, the teacher asks the students to look at the words
listed and translate them into their L1.
! If the students do not know their L1 equivalents, the teacher gives them.
! The teacher adopts the same method with synonyms, antonyms etc.
Step 6
! The teacher works through the grammar exercises.
! The students are given the rule for each exercise and at the same time
asked to translate the sentences into their L1.
! The students do all the exercises fill in the blanks, etc.
Step 7
! The teacher asks the students to translate the whole passage into their
mother- tongue and memorize vocabulary items.
! They are asked to write sentences for each vocabulary item.
Step 8
! Students are asked to write a composition based on the passage.
The Direct Method
Scope
! This method implies a radical change from literary language to the day – to
– day spoken language as the object of language teaching and learning.
Its salient features are:
! The use of every day vocabulary and structures.
! Grammar is taught
inductively.
! Oral skills are developed
through question – answer
sessions, interaction
exercises and intensive
classroom drills.
! Second language learning
is in the natural way as
humans learn their mother
– tongue.
! Concrete meanings are
taught through
demonstration, pictures,
objects etc. and abstract
meanings through
association of ideas.
! Both oral and listening skills are taught.
! Good pronunciation is aimed at and translation is avoided.
! Writing is kept away from the learner until after the printed word has been
introduced.
SALIENT FEATURES:
" The theory underlying this
approach is behaviourist habit –
formation.
" Speech habits are cultivated by
imitative drill.
" It teaches grammar inductively.
" The meaning of a word or structure
is not given either in L1 or L2.
Instead it is to be understood the
way it is used in a situation.
The learner is expected to use the
language learnt in the class room
to the outside world.
143
Normal Class Room Procedure:
! The teacher presents usually a short text.
! Difficult words and phrases are explained in the target language.
! Their understanding of the text is tested.
! Students do the exercises on grammar and learn the rules on their own.
! Exercises like dictation, free composition, pronunciation are given drills.
Critical Evaluation
! This method was introduced in France and Germany. In the US it is widely
known as the Berlitz method. It was quite successful in private language
schools. But it was difficult to implement in pubic secondary schools.
! It demanded high proficiency in spoken language and a native – like fluency
in non – native teachers.
! Its procedures and techniques were difficult. Teachers had to struggle hard
to explain in target – language.
! Learning second language in the same way in which first language was
acquired is not practically feasible as there was less time and opportunity
available in schools.
! No selection and grading of vocabulary and structures were carried out
which bewildered the pupils.
Practical application :
A typical Direct Method lesson would be completed in the following stages.
Stage 1
! The teacher places a big map of Harappa in front of the class and asks the
students to open their books at the page where the lesson is tilted.
‘ Harappa Civilization’
! Each student reads a sentence from the passage and the teacher points to
the part of the map the sentence describes.
Stage 2
! The teacher asks students if there have been any difficult words or
expressions.
OBJECTIVES:
" To help the students to speak
the target language fluently and
accurately.
" To make them write accurately
" To prepare them achieve true
bilingualism.
! If they have, the teachers tries
to make them understand the
meanings of the word /
expression by black board drawing
or contextual explanation.
Stage 3
! The teacher asks questions to
check whether they have
understood the passage.
! Students are also encouraged to
 ask questions to check whether they have understood the passage.
144
Stage 4
! Students do the exercises on grammar, filling in the blanks etc.
! They read the sentences aloud and supply the missing words.
Stage 5
! The teacher gives them a dictation exercise.
Stage 6
! The class practises pronunciation of words.
The Bilingual Method
Scope :
This method was developed by Dr. C.J. Dadson. As the name suggests, the method
makes use of two languages – the mother tongue and the target language. This
can be considered a combination of the Direct Method and the Grammar –
Translation Method.
The principles followed in the Bilingual Method:
! Foreign / second language can be learned with the help of L1.
! L1 is not used as translation but as a means to achieve the communicative
end.
! Words and sentences in the target language are presented with L1
equivalents.
! Sentence is the unit of teaching – not word.
! The use of the L1 is restricted to the teacher only. Students never say
anything in their L1.
! Once the students develop a sufficient command of the target language,
mother – tongue is completely withdrawn.
The normal procedure / steps in teaching:
1. The teacher reads out a dialogue to the class just once which the students
listen with their books closed.
2. The class repeats the lines after the teacher with their books open and
glancing at them between imitation responses.
3. Meaning is conveyed through the L1 equivalents at the sentence level.
4. The teacher says each sentence of the dialogue twice with L1 version
sandwitched between the two
5. Not word but utterance equivalents are given.
Critical Evaluation
! This method can not claim to be innovative because its procedures are not
much different from earlier methods.
! Students become dependent on their native tongue for understanding the
structure of the target language.
! The focus is on the grammatical structures rather than on how those
structures are used in everyday conversation.
145
! It places unusual demand on the teachers as they are to be proficient in
the two languages – L1 and L2.
! It does not seem to follow any set theory in language teaching and learning.
Practical Application:
Bilingual Methods uses a dialogue form to convey the meanings as in:
Teacher : Would you close the door, please?
Teacher : (Gives a sentence in L1 twice)
Teacher : Would you close the door, please?
Teacher : (directs the pupil(s) to repeat the sentence after him)
! No word, but utterance equivalents are given (either whole utterance or in
meaningful parts)
! Mother – tongue interference is allowed.
! Once the students achieve communicative proficiency, the mother – tongue
is withdrawn and the approach becomes monolingual.
The S – O – S Approach / Method
(The structural – oral – situational approach )
Scope
An eclectic approach evolved through the combination of certain aspects of the
Direct Method, the Oral approach and Audio lingualism came to be known SOS
(Structural – Oral – Situational Approach) in India. The basic assumptions of this
approach are as follows.
1. Learning a language is not only learning its words but also the syntax.
2. Vocabulary is presented through graded vocabulary lists.
3. Skills are presented in the following order: listening, speaking, reading
and writing (LSRW)
4. Sentence patterns exists and can form the basis of a language course.
In 1950, the SOS approach was officially accepted by the Madras Presidency
(consisting of the states of Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu). A massive
teacher training programme known as the MELT (Madras English Language
Teaching) campaign was organized to train all teachers in this new methodology.
Later the CIEFL, Hyderabad and the RIEs at Bangalore and Chandigarh also
propagated this approach. For four decades, till the 1990s, the SOS has been
practiced in schools in South India. Recently there have been attempts to shift to
the communicative paradigm, and there has been some resistance to this move.
Classroom Procedures:
A typical lesson in S-O-S approach is completed in three phases:
a. Presentation : introduction of new vocabulary / grammatical items in
contexts.
b. Practice : Oral but controlled practice of the items.
c. Production : a free practice in the language items learnt in
phase (b).
146
Critical Evaluation:
1. It helps to develop a learner’s competence in the use of structures in the
target language.
2. Its emphasis on the use of language in contexts and situations that are in
immediate environment made it more viable.
3. Concrete linguistic items are taught through demonstration and abstract
ideas through association.
4. Class room teaching and learning are made enjoyable.
Yet the S- O- S Approach has the following drawbacks also.
! The situations are not real – life – situations. They are structural drills in
which objects, pictures and realia are used.
! The approach evokes reactions from teachers who had to carry a lot of
things to the class room.
! They find it difficult to make abstract ideas understood by the learner.
! The approach is found to be suitable only at the elementary level not at the
higher classes.
! For teaching prose, poetry and composition, the approach has been found
inadequate and ineffective.
! Language can never be an accumulation of habits, as argued by the
mentalists like Noam Chomsky.
Practical Application:
The teacher has started teaching ‘adjectives.’ He has already used ‘ large’ with a
singular noun. Now he is using ‘small’ plus ‘so’ and ‘such’ with a plural or singular
noun.
Teacher : Look at these books.
They’re small and thin, aren’t they?
They’re so small that I can put three of them in my pocket.
These are such small books that I can put three of them in my pocket.
Who is the best runner in this class?
Students : Paul is
Teacher : Yes.
Paul is such a good runner that no one can catch him.
The teacher writes on the board:
Paul runs so fast that no one can catch him. Paul is such a good runner that
no one can catch him.
Exploration
In Tamil Nadu, we have been learning English from class I onwards. Even after 12
years of a language study that amounts to roughly 2200 days of learning, do you
think we have acquired the basic skills of communication in English?
147
Task 1
Discuss :
What measures would you suggest for acquiring the communicative competence
in English?
Task 2
Discuss:
Have our teachers teaching English for primary class children been following any
particular method all these years? What is that method?
Task 3
Given below are two exercises used in a language classroom by two different
teachers. Look through them carefully and identify the differences between them.
1. Choose a partner. Now imagine that you are a fortune – teller. Your partner
is interested in knowing about his future, and will ask you some questions.
Try to predict his future for him.
2. Use the following table and make as many sentences as you can.
We will go to London next week.
They watch a movie tomorrow.
The Children play tennis this evening.
Now, answer the following questions.
1. What is being taught in this exercise?
2. Which exercise could become mechanical?
3. In which exercise is there very little possibility of making mistakes?
4. Which exercise is closer to real- life communication?
5. Which exercise gives greater freedom to the learner?
LATEST TRENDS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEACHING
Scope:
! The different methods and approaches we have discussed in the previous
chapter concentrated on the components of the English language, namely
words, structures, word – order, grammar etc. But language is a means of
communication. The approaches mentioned earlier have almost ignored
this function of the language and succeeded in imparting knowledge of
language forms and rules. Thus our students acquired linguistic competence.
They must have acquired communicative competence also.
 ****
148
! In Britain, scholars like Christopher Candlin and Henry Widdowson
advocated a functional approach to language learning that gradually gained
currency and came to be known as Communicative Language Teaching or
CLT.
Development
COMMUNICATIVE LANGUAGE TEACHING (CLT)
Scope
In 1972, a new language course was proposed in Europe which aims to make
communicative competence the goal of language teaching. Here the focus was on
what the learner needed to understand and express through the target language
and not on the accumulation of grammatical items and structures.
Objectives:
! It aims to develop communicative competence in learners so that they become
effective communicators in the target language.
! The focus is on meanings and functions rather than on the form of the
language.
! It is the learner and his learning that are more important.
! Language is acquired rather than learnt consciously.
! The teacher facilitates language acquisition through problem solving
activities and tasks which ensure learner participation and interaction.
! The aim is to involve the learner in the learning process so that language
develops automatically and spontaneously.
! All the four language skills- listening, speaking, reading and writing – receive
equal treatment.
Critical Evaluation:
! CLT is basically an eclectic approach to foreign language learning.
! Class room learning involves lot of activities like group / pair work, language
games, role – plays, simulations, question – answer sessions related to the
students’ personal experiences.
! Learning is not confined to any set of text books. Materials include
newspapers, magazines, graphics, visuals, filmstrips, wall charts etc.
! The class room is a hub of activities and the lessons are mostly task –
based and problem solving solutions.
Drawbacks in CLT
1. There is not a single, uniform method that could be called ‘communicative’.
Different practitioners use different techniques to involve learners in the
process of learning.
2. Students are to learn English without the help of text books. This results
in no formal teaching taking place in the class.
149
3. Several roles are assigned for the teachers in CLT. The teacher should be
a facilitator, group process manager, counsellor and an independent
participant within the teaching – learning group. These responsibilities are
really too much for the teachers.
Practical Application:
Warm – ups: A warm – up task is a small task given just in the beginning of the
class to develop interest in students. It does not normally take more than five
minutes.
a) Simple Game
All the students in the class are given a card bearing a letter – pattern as
shown below. Each student is asked to write down on a sheet of paper all
the words they can make from the letters provided the middle letter appears
in each. It is a timed game. The student with maximum words wins.
 T M
 E
 O N
b) Tasks: The following is a discussion – group activity. It would take 20 – 30
minutes:
Step 1 :
The students are divided into groups of 4 or more. One of the students is
chosen as group leader for reporting the group’s observation.
Step 2:
Each member of the group receives a copy of the following activity. The
class is explained what the task is about. Each group is asked to discuss
what items they would choose for survival on the moon and why?
Survival on the Moon
You are a member of a space crew originally scheduled to meet with a mother
ship on the lighted surface of the moon. Because of mechanical difficulties, your
ship was forced to land at a place 200 km from the meeting point. During the
landing, much of the equipment aboard was damaged, and since survival depends
on reaching the mother ship, the most critical items available must be chosen for
the 200 km trip. Below are listed fifteen items left intact and undamaged after
landing. Your task is to rank and order them in terms of importance to your crew
in allowing them to reach the meeting point.
150
- Match box
- Food concentrate
- 50 feet nylon rope
- Parachute silk
- Portable heating unit
- Two 0.45 caliber pistols
- One case of dehydrated milk
- Two 100 – pound tasks of oxygen
- Stellar map
- Lift raft
- Magnetic compass
- 5 gallons of water
- signal flares
- First – aid kit containing injection needles
- Solar – powered FM receiver – transmitter
Step 3:
Once the activity is over, the group leader presents his group’s ranking order and
defends it too. Other groups can seek clarifications.
Step 4: At the end, the teacher gives the handout containing the approved ranking.
Any task does not simply concentrate on one particular skill but aims to develop
skills in an integrative way. Usually all tasks are completed in three stages:
Stage 1 : Pre – task.
The teacher gives a warm-up task to develop interest in students. It could be 1
– 2 minute question – answer session or a picture, diagram, etc that the
teacher feels would make students curious about what is going to come
next.
Stage 2 : While – task
What is that the students have to do while they are doing the task? Do they
have to listen to something (tape – recording, etc), read a text silently and
answer the question? Such decisions have to be taken before hand.
Stage 3: Post – task
After the second stage is over, what does the teacher want students to do
further?
It could be a home assignment. The teacher will have to identify which
tasks would suit at what level of learning.
Activity Based Learning (ABL Method)
Learning through activity is a new approach in the teaching of English language.
Generally teaching of English to non - English speaking people is a difficult task.
From time immemorial several attempts have been made to simplify the process
of teaching English to non English speaking people. An earnest attempt has been
made to teach English to the pupils of the schools of Chennai Corporation through
well-designed and developed cards and through a ladder by the Department of
Education of the Corporation of Chennai with the assistance of UNICEF and
professional support of selected DTERT and DIET faculty. Further the ladders
151
prepared are strictly in accordance with the syllabi published by the Government
of Tamil Nadu recently.
This system of learning, not only simplifies the process of teaching and learning
but also makes it more logical and natural. Exposure to an English environment
is an imperative aspect on the part of the learners to acquire the right type of
pronunciation of English vocabulary. Adequate provision is made on the ladder to
create an English atmosphere in the classroom. Learning involves listening,
speaking, reading, and writing. This is something like supporting a huge structure
on four pillars. Absence of a single pillar will cause much damage to the structure
itself. Likewise negligence of any one of the four processes of learning will
result in irreparable damage to the learning process. So utmost care is taken to
strengthen the process of learning.
Separate logos are assigned for each learning activity. Names of vehicles are
selected as Logos for English. Same logos are given for the same kind of activities.
These logos are distributed in the milestones. Each milestone has various steps.
The initial milestone in each standard is termed as zero milestone. These zero
milestones are for making the children ready for learning. A minimum of 10 days
can be spent to complete each milestone in each standard. The zero milestone in
the II Std is to revise what they have learned in their I standard.
The following activities are included in the learning process.
I. Listening
# Rhymes.
# The letters of the alphabet.
# The words relating to home and school environment.
# Greetings and responses.
# Informal conversations.
# Simple commands and instructions.
II. Speaking:-
# Asking and answering simple common questions.
# Making polite requests.
# Saying “Thank you” and “Sorry” wherever necessary.
# Asking for permission.
# Expressing their needs.
III. Reading:-
# Recognizing lower and upper case of letters of the English alphabet.
# Reading words with pictures.
# Reading words without pictures.
# Reading words.
IV. Writing.
# Drawing and painting.
# Drawing lines and curves leading to writing.
# Writing letters of the alphabet.
# Writing words.
152
To attain perfection in the above said process of learning , a lot of activities are
suggested. These activities are very carefully designed to suit to the age and
grasping power of the children. They are arranged in the ladder in a natural
sequence. As the activities are given in cards both the teachers and the pupils
can use them quite easily and effectively. Quite a large number of self learning
activities are given for the children to learn themselves. Children will have self
satisfaction and a sense of achievement, feeling of happiness after completing
each card. There is provision for the fast learners to go fast at their own speed.
The slow learners without any hindrance can proceed at their own pace. As the
learning process goes through the ladder the children know well what they have
learned and what they have to learn later . No teacher can skip any step as he/
she is forced to go by the steps, stated in the ladder. There is provision for those
children who for some reason or other could not attend school for some days.
They can proceed with their learning from where they left on the day they last
attended school.
Evaluation is a continuous process. To test the level of achievement of the children
test cards are provided. Pictures are drawn in the test cards to invigorate the
children and to make them feel and believe that evaluation is not a burden but a
lively and interesting activity. Further it is done then and there. There are
examinations twice a year.
Logos used in the ladder:-
Pencil, custard apple, pot, kit-box, baby walker, tricycle, bicycle, cycle-rickshaw,
motorcycle, car, auto, train, tractor, van, aeroplane, road roller, parisal, boat,
scooter, catamaran, rocket, bus and lorry.
These logos are classified as general and specific. General logos are common for
all subjects such as Tamil, Maths and EVS. Specific logos are meant only for
English.
ACTIVE LEARNING METHOD (ALM METHOD)
What is Active learning and Why is it important?
The term "active learning" has been more understood intuitively than defined in
commonly accepted terms. As a result many educators say that all learning is
active. Are not students actively involved while listening to lectures or
presentations in the classroom? Research however, suggests that students must
do more than just listen: They must read, write, discuss or be engaged in solving
problems . Further, students must be engaged in such higher-order thinking
tasks as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, to be actively involved. Thus strategies
promoting activities that involve students in doing things and thinking about what
they are doing may be called active learning.
Bonwell and Eison state "...that students must do more than just listen: They
must read, write, discuss, or be engaged in solving problems. Most important, to
be actively involved, students must engage in such higher-order thinking tasks
as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Within this context, it is proposed that
strategies promoting active learning be defined as instructional activities involving
students in doing things and thinking about what they are doing."
153
Use of these techniques in the classroom is vital because of their powerful impact
upon students' learning. Studies have shown that students prefer strategies
promoting active learning to traditional lectures. Other research studies evaluating
students' achievement have demonstrated that many strategies promoting active
learning are comparable to lectures in promoting the mastery of content but
superior to lectures in promoting the development of students' skills in thinking
and writing. Some cognitive research has shown that a large number of individuals
have learning styles that are best approached using pedagogical techniques other
than lecturing. While the past decade has seen an explosion of interest among
college faculty in 'active learning' and cooperative learning', college faculty still
teach their classes in the traditional lecture mode. There remains much
misunderstanding of and some mistrust of what such a move may imply. Active
learning stands in contrast to "standard" modes of instruction in which teachers
do most of the talking and students are passive.
When you have learned something you have changed your brain physically.
There is a consensus among researchers that we do not learn by passively receiving,
and then remembering what we are taught. Learning involves actively constructing
our own meanings. Actually construction of connections between neurons happens
as we invent our own concepts and ideas, connected to what we already know.
This “meaning-making” theory of learning is called ‘constructivism’. We must
remember that neuronal connections are happening all the time. The question is
whether we are aware of the connections being made. Thus active learning seems
to involve an inward looking, simultaneous with the outward looking. Active learning
refers to techniques where students do more than simply listen to a lecture.
Students are DOING something including discovering, processing, and applying
information. Active learning "derives from two basic assumptions:
(1) that learning is by nature an active endeavour and
(2) that different people learn in different ways"
It is important to remember, however, that lecture does have its place and that
active learning cannot happen without content or objectives. Education once was
thought of as a process of transmission (i.e., pouring knowledge into empty vessels),
research has made it abundantly clear that the quality of teaching and learning
is improved when students have enough opportunities to clarify, question, apply,
and consolidate new knowledge. Many teaching strategies can be employed to
actively engage students in the learning process. Some of these are group
discussions, problem solving, case studies, role plays, journal writing, and
structured learning groups. The benefits of using such activities include improved
critical thinking skills, increased retention and absorption of new information,
increased motivation, and improved interpersonal skills. However, research also
indicates that by reorganizing or adapting the ways they present material to
students, instructors can create an environment in which knowledge retention
is significantly increased; of course, such situations require the cooperation of
the students themselves. One of the best methods is to implement so-called
active learning.
Active learning is involving students directly and actively in the learning process
itself. This means that instead of simply receiving information verbally and visually,
students are receiving and participating and doing. Thus active learning is:
154
! engaging students in doing something other than listening to a lecture and
taking notes
! Students may be involved in talking and listening to one another,
! or writing, reading and reflecting individually or in small groups
WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTS OF ACTIVE LEARNING METHODOLOGIES IN THE
CLASSROOM?
Active learning methodologies require that the student must find opportunities to
meaningfully talk and listen, write, read, and reflect on the content, ideas, issues,
and concerns of an academic subject.
Merits of active learning are:
! Students are involved in learning.
! less emphasis is placed on transmitting information and
! greater emphasis on developing students' skills,
! students are involved in higher-order thinking (analysis, synthesis,
evaluation),
! students are engaged in activities (e.g., reading discussing, writing), and
! greater emphasis is placed on students' exploration of their own attitudes
and values.
“Active learning shifts the focus from the teacher to the student and from
delivery of subject content by teacher to active engagement with the material
by the student. Through appropriate inputs from the teacher, students learn
and practice how to apprehend knowledge and use them meaningfully.”
ACTIVE LEARNING needs a structure and an atmosphere...
Best structures for active learning
! where there is no competition
! where seating favours discussion and peer learning
! where it is explicit that class space is for learning by ‘doing some things’
and
! the ‘doing’ is defined such that it can be seen as meaningful and applied in
other contexts
! mixed age environments are also a possibility
Some assumptions have to be shifted. We need to create learning structures
in which
! engagement is more important than demonstrable, measurable results
! well being is more important than performance
! class structure will not permit regression to the older mode...
! initiative is welcome and hierarchy is not, ALM processes are considered
suitable for learning in many situations, including the covering of the given
academic content at the level of grades 6,7 and 8.
155
A word for the teacher
While choosing modes of instruction, it is good to bear in mind that student
learning depends primarily on what the students do rather than what the
teacher does. Thus a thoughtful approach to effective teaching requires that
educators grow aware of the many strategies promoting active learning. These
have been successfully used across many disciplines. Further, each educator
needs to reflect on some questions:
! Am I willing to experiment with alternative approaches to instruction?
! Are techniques of active and cooperative learning alternatives to lectures,
or are they enhancements of lectures?.
Exploration:
! Most of the time, it is the English language learners who are the victims of
our educational system and management. What are your suggestions? Debate
in groups and come forward with your points.
! Can we go for an eclectic method combining the salient features / techniques
of various methods for helping the children learn English language in a
better way?
What is your idea on ELT campaign that was very effectively catering to the inservice
needs of primary and secondary school teachers in English language
teaching methodology and spoken and linguistic competence?

SCOPE
It may be useful to begin this chapter by listing some questions which teachers
and students have asked about vocabulary and language study. We hope to try
OBJECTIVES OF LEARNING
VOCABULARY:
! To know a word in a target language
may mean the ability to:
! recognize it in its spoken / written
form.
! recall it when needed.
! relate it to an appropriate objective or
concept.
! use it in the appropriate grammatical
form.
! pronounce it
! speak in a recognizable way.
! spell it clearly and correctly.
! use it with words that correctly goes
with it.
i.e., in the correct collocation.
! be aware of its connotations and
associations.
and lay some foundations from
which answers might be found:
" How many words provide a
working vocabulary in a
foreign language?
" What are the best words to
learn first?
" In the early stages of
learning a second / foreign
language, are some words
more useful to the learners
than others?
" Are some words more
difficult than others? Can
words be graded for ease of
learning?
" What are the best means of
retaining new words?
" Is it most practical to learn
words as single items in a
list, in pairs (for example as
translation equivalents) or
in contexts?
" What about words which
have different meanings?
Should they be avoided? If not, should some meanings be isolated for learning
first?
DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIT
Learning a new language is basically a matter of learning the vocabulary of that
language. Not being able to find the words you need to express is the most
frustrating experience in speaking another language. Of course vocabulary is not
the whole of the language. The system of the language (its ‘grammar’ or ‘structure’)
is also important: how the plural is formed, how past tense is signified and so on.
Nevertheless it is possible to have a good knowledge of how the system of a
language works and yet not be able to communicate in it; whereas if we have the
vocabulary we need, it is usually possible to communicate.
TEACHING VOCABULARY
UNIT – 5
157
(i) Active and passive vocabulary
Anyone who learns a new language is likely to recognize more words than he can
produce. It is difficult to produce a word correctly. One has to pronounce or spell
it in the right way, use it in the correct grammatical form, use it appropriately
with the correct words coming before and after it and so on. It may therefore be
important for a teacher to decide which words she wishes the students to produce
correctly. These words form the ‘productive’ or ‘active’ vocabulary. The teacher
also should decide which words she wishes her students merely to recognize.
These words form the ‘receptive’ or ‘passive’ vocabulary.
Producing (speaking or writing) words in the target language makes much greater
demands on the learner. Of course in productive vocabulary, the learner has an
advantage in that he is able to choose which word he wishes to use: whereas in
receptive vocabulary (as in listening or reading) he has to handle whatever
language the speaker or writer uses.
(ii) Selection and Grading
General service list published in 1953 is the outcome of almost three decades of
major work in English lexicometric. The major contributors to this work are Michael
West himself whose work in English as a foreign language was concentrated in
Bengal in India and Harold Palmer – one of the founding fathers of English Language
Teaching (ELT) who was the Director of the institute of ELT in Tokyo from 1923 –
1936.
West is also known for his New Method Readers and his New Method Dictionary
which makes use of controlled vocabulary for graded teaching in a second language.
Michael West’s General Service List consists of 2000 words with Semantic (meaning)
and frequency information drawn from a corpus of two to five million words. It is
claimed that knowing these 2000 words gives access to about 80% of the words in
any written text and thus stimulates motivation.
The main criteria of West, Palmer and others for the selection of vocabulary
for learning in the early stage are:
(a) The frequency of each word in written English should be indicated.
(b) Information should be provided about the relative prominences of the various
meanings and uses of a word form.
e.g. Look at these sentences:
(1) Kandan is sitting on the bank of the river.
(2) I am going to the bank to draw some money.
Is the word ‘bank’ in sentences 1 & 2 the same?
The word ‘bank’ has the same form in both the sentences. But it has a different
meaning in sentence (1) from the meaning of ‘bank’ in sentence (2). It is the
context of the sentence which shows which meaning of ‘bank’ is being used.
(c) Universality (words useful in all countries).
(d) Utility (enabling discussion on as wide a subject range as possible)
For classroom teachers and the material producers the following guidelines
may be useful in selection and grading :
1. Words selected should include
a) Those frequently used.
158
b) All structural words.
c) Words which are useful because other words can be built from them
e.g. Spot-spotted, spotless, spotty and unspotted.
2. In the first year we should have vocabulary referring to concrete things –
things that can be seen, touched and gradually we should proceed from
concrete to abstract.
Mr. Billow’s four concentric circles can make a basis for this
i) the class room.
ii) the home environment.
iii) vocabulary from outside the classroom and home environment which can
be introduced with the help of the pictures and
iv) similar vocabulary but which cannot be introduced in this way.
In the first year, when the students have fully grasped the vocabulary and
structures concerning class room objects, they should go on to structures and
vocabulary concerning the home environment. Similarly in the second year, they
should be introduced to structures dealing with things outside their environment
with the help of pictures and other audio-visual aids, proceeding from the known
to the unknown. As and when the children move on grasping sufficient vocabulary
concerning concrete objects, we have to introduce vocabulary and structure relating
to abstract things outside their own experience.
The first verb introduced should be am / are / is (this is a book). Afterwards the
idea of continuous tenses should be taken up. Later on in the coming years, the
tenses introduced should include the definite and perfect ones.
The need for controlled composition with the pictures and other visual aids must
also influence the grading of vocabulary and structures.
3. How to decide – in later stages - which word is simple and which is difficult.
Look at this sentence:
I’m not going to put up with this behaviour any longer.
All the words in this sentence link with one another and help to make up the
sense of the sentence; but three words in particular, “put up with” are firmly
linked together: they operate as a unit – and have one meaning (roughly ‘tolerate’
or ‘endure’) so here we have three words for one lexical item (Refer to ‘phrasal
verbs’ in the unit on CONTENT – SECOND YEAR. The concept of lexical item as
one kind of unit of meaning is useful to the teacher, as it helps to make clear
what is being taught. It reveals one reason why a difficult word like ‘helicopter’
which has only one meaning may be easier to teach them a so called ‘simple’
word like ‘head’ which may be in several different lexical items:
- a hat on my head.
- at the head [ = top ] of the page.
- the head [ = boss ] of the business.
- to head [ = lead] a team etc.
However one may feel in the end that there is no such thing as ‘the perfect’
order or grading. We teach many new words nowadays as children are picking
up a large number of vocabulary items outside the school through the electronic
and print media. They are growing linguistically too. They come to school with
a precious wealth of vocabulary. So we need not restrict them to a limited
159
(iii) Techniques to introduce words
Each new word needs to be taught in the following four aspects:
1.
Children learn :
pronunciation – through the teacher’s model.
meaning – through realia, pictures, gestures / explanation,
spelling – through syllabification and
usage – through different sentences.
Frequent exposure and repetition:
If the word has to be a part of learner’s productive (or active) vocabulary, he must
be given the opportunity to use it, as often as it is necessary for him to recall it,
with the correct pronunciation. It’s not enough that it should happen only in one
lesson. Since the learner is exposed to a large number of words, the words he is
meant to remember should crop up at regular intervals in later lessons.
Inferencing (or guessing) procedures
Many language teaching programmes aspire to teach only about 2000 words. Are
the remaining words learnt from a dictionary? Almost certainly not. If the meanings
have not been supplied by outside sources, as it were, then where have they been
found?
The answer is, of course, that we guess the meanings of the words by hearing
them used in a certain situation or by reading them in a certain context and
guessing their meaning from the context. Usually it is clear in a situation what
vocabulary. Let’s make use of
their experience and knowledge
of vocabulary, build on it and see
whether it is helpful both to the
learner and to the teacher.
- As we all know – ‘The proof of
the pudding is in eating’.
TASK 1
! Refer to a good dictionary and
list out the various meanings of
the word - table.
TASK 2
! Find out the one word which is
used in the sense of : a physical
organ; ‘a group’, ‘corpse’, ‘mass’
and ‘trunk’ or ‘mainpart’.
160
particular thing some one is referring to: in a written context, a bit more intuitive
work may be called for.
At the very elementary level, the teacher’s help may be in the form of
1. drawings on the black board / pictures / real objects.
2. use of mime, gestures.
One obvious method of checking the pupils’ understanding might be simply to ask
the students to say the equivalent in their mother tongue (Teacher should not
translate the meaning) or in simpler English – What do you think ‘X’ means.
As and when the students progress to higher classes –
- it is important to train students to go for the overall meaning of the text
they are reading and not allow themselves to be put off or distracted by
individual words that they don’t know.
- most common words like head, table, bank as already illustrated have a
vast range of denotations – which one is appropriate will depend on the
meaning of the passage as a whole.
In dealing with individual words in the higher classes, the teacher really has
a choice of four techniques:
1) to explain the meaning of the difficult words, gloss in simpler English. This
is the procedure adopted in many course books, where there is a vocabulary
list or glossary with the passage.
2) To get the students to check up the target words in their dictionaries.
3) To try to get the meaning of the word from the class, and if they don’t know
try to get them to guess or infer the meaning.
(Although it takes most class time this technique may well be the most
efficient in the long run).
4) To simply ignore the word, unless a question about it is raised by the students.
This does not mean that the teacher is not ‘doing her duty’. It is not always
necessary to understand the meaning of every single word in a passage to
get the general or overall sense of the passage.
Translation (Use or misuse?)
At one time almost all foreign language teaching was done by translation. All
expressions in the target language were immediately translated and new words
were usually recorded in a ‘vocabulary notebook’. The result of this approach was,
usually, that the target language (English) was used very little in the classroom.
Most of the time was taken up with the mother tongue. The students had very
little opportunity to practice using the foreign vocabulary in conversation or even
in writing and hardly ever got to the point of ‘thinking’ in the foreign language.
Many of us are victims to this ‘easy’ approach.
Teachers might feel that use of mother tongue, can save a lot of time, and also
perhaps, reassure the learner in a situation he thinks to be threatening.
161
But still the disadvantages are many as pointed out. If we think that translation
is an easy way out, think of this – “At what cost?”.
Reference to translation raises one further issue namely – the effect on the
burden of learning of the order of presentation. The research findings (Paul Nation
– 1982) concludes that if vocabulary is needed for productive use (for speaking
and writing) then a learning sequence of mother tongue word – foreign language
word would be appropriate. A direction of foreign word - mother tongue may be
more appropriate if only reading and listening (receptive use) are required.
On the whole, however, translation of vocabulary into the mother tongue should
be kept under tight control – to the barest minimum. From the upper primary
stage onwards, it is better to present a word (only if it cannot be elicited) by using
simple explanation in the target language (Not in mother tongue). Apart from
giving the students additional exposure to the target language, this technique
has another benefit. If, on a future occasion, he is not able to recall the new
word, he can always give an explanation. This is a technique that is, infact, often
used by us in our mother tongue. When we cannot think of the best word in a
particular situation students can approximate by giving a synonymous or
explanation. Students who have been taught by translation techniques often give
up if the exact word or phrase does not come to mind. Those who are used to
operating in the ‘target language will often have alternative phrasing to help
them. (As learners become more proficient they have to learn to rely more on
their own inferential skills by decoding words in context. The context may be
spoken or written and the extent of decoding may stretch to several sentences
before the word can be understood).
162
163
As teachers of English; we all should know the three following terms not only for
teaching but also for using vocabulary effectively.
(1) Connotation (2) Collocation (3) Association.
1. Connotation
What is the difference between a fat baby and a plump one? Denotatively, that is,
in terms of who they are referring to, there may be no difference at all – The slim
person, the thin person, the skinny person may all be the same weight. The
choice of one phrase rather than the other will probably indicate how the speaker
feels about the person. Certain words are chosen because, they convey some
kind of feeling or judgement. For example if you approve of the way in which some
one sticks to his opinions, you may appreciate the fact that he is resolute or
determined. To some one for whom this kind of behaviour seem to be awkward, or
nuisance, the same person may be called ‘stubborn or obstinate’. We say therefore
that words like skinny, fat, stubborn or obstinate tend to have unfavourable
connotation whereas words like slim, resolute or determined tend to be used
with intended favourable connotation.
2. Collocation: or word relation.
A simple example of two words having almost same meaning. Which word should
go with which is illustrated here. The words are ‘distant’ and ‘remote’. The grid
illustrates the overlapping but distinct collocability of these two words.
164
distant remote
+ _ view of the tower,
+ _ cousin of mine.
+ _ future
+ + past
_ + possibility
_ + village
(+ sign shows the right collocation).
3. Association
Similar to the connotation of a word is its association. Whereas connotations
relate to the system of the language, associations relate to the individual or the
culture.
For example while words like father or home generally have favourable association
for most people, they may have unfavourable association for someone who had a
very unhappy home life. A word like ‘market’ may have very different association
for someone coming from a rural area (shandy) as opposed to a city dweller.
Similarly it may be very difficult to convey the association that countryside had
for a nature poet like Wordsworth to a child to whom wild, uncultivated areas are
more dangerous and threatening.
Clearly there is not much to be done about the private association which words
have for individuals, but the teacher may well feel that the association which
relate to the culture of the target language and certainly the connotations of a
particular word are part of the “meaning” which has to be learned.
Task 6 (a) : Using the best words suited for particular contexts – (Register)
GLOBAL PROBLEMS
A. Disasters / tragedies
)
165
Vocabulary expansion
There is plenty of scope to expand our limited vocabulary. Just as we did a task
on prefixes with – ‘mis’ here is a production exercise for suffixes.
Example:
The ending-‘ify’ is often used when something is caused or brought about by
someone. For instance, if a chemist turned something that was solid into a
liquid he is said to have liquified it.
166
Here are a few vocabulary activities for the primary school children.
1. Display with vocabulary key:
Look at the drawing of the front view of a car. The twelve parts of the car that
are numbered there are also listed below. Put the correct number opposite to
each item in the list. If there are any terms that you are unfamiliar with,
check them up in your dictionary.
Term Number in drawing
(a) steering wheel ............................
(b) radiator grille ............................
(c) bumper (Br.) ............................
(d) sidelight ............................
(e) bonnet (Br.) ............................
(f) indicator light ............................
(g) wing-mirror ............................
(h) number plate ............................
(i) windscreen wiper (Br.) / (Am.) ............................
(j) headlight / headlamp ............................
(k) windscreen ............................
(l) rear-view mirror ............................
What other parts of a car do you know? Make a drawing (or some drawings) to
show where they are.
2. Connections:
This has to be done by children quickly. Each child in turn says a word which he
associates with the word given by the previous child. Sometime the teacher or
another player may ask the person who has just given the word to explain the
connections he has made.
167
Example : Child 1 Tree
Child 2 Birds
Child 3 Nest
Child 4 Shade
Child 5 Cattle / bull / cow
Teacher : Why did you say ‘cattle’?
Child 5 : Because they take rest under the tree. You can make it as a
game by awarding scores.
3. Course book recall
This uncomplicated but ingenious activities is for students who have used
atleast a few units of a particular course book.
Procedure:
i) Give the students five / ten minutes to look through the course book and
remember the vocabulary learnt so far.
ii) Individually students look for a stipulated number of different words they
have learned from the book and got them down.
iii) Ask the children to close their books and get into pairs.
iv) In pairs students take turns reading their words out. Their partners try to
remember where in the book each word was used and what the topic,
context or situation was.
4. Rhyme Time
This activity can be done orally to begin with. Later work sheets can be given to
the children to write the answer.
Teacher writes the following words on the black board and reads them out.
Children read out the words.
5. Directions to children:
Read these words. One of them will rhyme with the last word in the first line of
the set below. Write the word in the blank
1. All of us
went on a _________.
2. To run and run
is a lot of _________.
3. It will be a fun
to eat a __________.
4. A little cub
sat in a __________.
5. The new soft bud
fell in the __________.
168
6. Do you know this word? (Upper primary level)
This activity
i) focuses on revision of vocabulary, reading, spelling and most importantly
confidence building.
ii) encourages slow-learners to begin to read English magazines and
Newspapers and
iii) equips them with a starting strategy for getting something out of texts that
they think are beyond their understanding?
Preparation :
Find an advertisement in a magazine or Newspaper that includes a) a picture and
b) different kinds and sizes of print.
Procedure :
Give out the copies of the advertisement and ask the students to use pen, pencil
or crayons to underline every word they know.
- Then students form pairs and compare what they have marked. If they
discover other words they know, they can mark them now.
- Read out the first word and ask students if they have marked it. Proceed in
this way with every word (Sometimes after you read a word, students may
mark it because they knew the word by sound and not by spelling).
- Ask basic comprehension question about the text and/or ask the students
to tell you, in their own language, some of the ideas expressed in the text.
Underlining of words encourages the students to notice how
many words they already know. If they proceed word by word
this is bound to be quite a lot. They will be filled with joy and a
sense of achievement.
7. Vocabulary brain shower
This activity is called brain shower because it’s more restricted than a brain
storm.
Procedure:
- Introduce the theme of the lesson for example jobs.
- Ask the students to take a piece of paper each and rule it into 3 columns.
The first is headed – ‘ words I know ’
The second column – ‘ words I’m not very sure of ’
The third column – ‘ words I would like to know ’
- Students write 3 to 5 words in each column. For the last column they can
write a definition in English, or draw it or write the word in their own
language.
- In groups of two or three they compare their lists, try to check the middle
column and complete the third column using dictionaries, if necessary.
169
(in one trial class some of the words the students wanted to know were milk
man, stock broker & green grocer.)
8. ‘S’ my name is Selvi.
Another interesting game for individual student. Each player has to say what
Selvi likes, but the answer must take the form of an adjective + noun – both
beginning with ‘S’ – Award score for the correct sentence.
The teacher points to players at random who will say things like:
Selvi likes silk sarees.
Selvi likes silly stories.
Selvi likes scented soap and so on.
For variation the name may be changed to Babu (Letter ‘B’), Mary (Letter M).
The game should move quickly. Give the students a few minutes to prepare
their sentences.
The same activity can be done in the primary class with a little lesser degree
of challenge. Every, child can participate for example ‘A’.
e.g:A- My name is Ayesha.
I live in Ambattur.
I like Apples.
9. Tasks with dictionary
Prepare several cards like the one given below:
Word :
Meaning :
Examples :
My language :
I am reading a book about mammals.
Meaning: A mammal is an animal that gives milk to its babies.
Examples: Dogs, Cats, Lions, humans.
The word in my language: _______________________
I am reading a book about reptiles.
Meaning: A reptile is a Cold-blooded animal.
Examples: Lizards, Snakes
The word in my language: _______________________
170
I am reading a book about carnivores.
Meaning: A carnivores is an animal that eats only meat.
Examples: Lions, Great White Sharks
The word in my language: _______________________
I am reading a book about molluscs.
Meaning: A mollusc is an animal that has a soft body.
Examples: snail, octopus, worms
Learner’s language:
I am reading a book about amphibians.
Meaning: An animal that is born in water but can live on land.
Examples: Frogs
The word in my language : _______________________
I am reading a book about insects.
Meaning: An insect is an animal that has six legs and three body sections.
Examples: Ant, Grasshopper, Bee
The word in my language: _______________________
One student picks up a card with a strange word. Writes the spelling, meaning,
examples and native language translation of the word.
Eg.
Encourage children to use English and asking you their doubts for filling in the
cards. You call out the new word.
Children : Can you repeat that please?
How do you spell _____________?
What does _____________ mean?
Can you give an example?
How do you say it in Tamil?
Encourage the students to refer to a good dictionary and complete their
cards.
171
Things that : Come in pairs; can fly; float in water; move fast;
make a lot of noise; you can’t buy.
10. Ten things
Divide the class into two teams and choose one from each team to come to the
blackboard to write. Call out some categories. Let the children think of ten
things in that category. The person chosen writes the list on the blackboard.
The first team to write the list wins 10 points.
Categories
In the lower primary class, the same game can be modified as follows:
Call out a letter of the alphabet children can say or write 3 words beginning
with the letter.
Eg: ‘d’ – dog, doll, door.
Here are a few exercises at your (trainees) level. Do these and strengthen
your vocabulary skill.
I. Pick out the right word from the brackets to fill the blank space in each
sentence. The words look similar but do not mean the same thing.
1. Please ____________________ your work for a few minutes. I turned over
another _______________________ in my book. (leaf, leaves, leave)
2. You should keep your purse in your bag or you will ___________ your money.
The page in my book is ______________and will fallout soon.
(lose, loosen, loose)
3. I am afraid of the thunder and ________________________ in a storm. Be
careful when you are ___________________ the fire. (light, lighting, lightning).
4. Please tie this string with a strong ___________, I asked her to come to
school but did ______________ (not, note, knot).
5. What is the ________________ of this line? I can measure and tell you how
_______________________it is. (long, longer, length).
6. Please give me a small _______________ of paper. The two countries made
__________________ when the war was over. (peace, piece, peas).
7. What is the _______________ of a new bike in this shop? I did not win a
__________ in last year’s bike race. (praise, prize, price).
8. The __________ of the sun fall upon the earth and warm it. When I ________
the lid of the box, it makes a noise. (rise, rays, raise).
9. He, she, it, they ______ These small words are not nouns, they are ___________
Tell me how to _________this word correctly.
(pronounce, pronouns, renounce)
172
II.Word Trap
Which is the correct word to use in each of the following sentences?
Use the word you reject in another sentence to show its exact meaning.
1. Refusing to believe that ghosts inhabited the old mansion the ________
(sceptic, septic), proposed to spend a night there.
2. Although the President wished to talk freely with the people, she was treated
_____________ (formerly, formally).
3. Without its full ___________ (complement, compliment) the ship was not
permitted to leave the port.
4. In doubt about his future career, the boy arranged an interview with the
student __________________ (councilor, counsellor).
5. The girl had been diffident about taking up teaching but found it a __________
occupation later (congenital, congenial).
III. Word net work
With more advanced students (like you trainees) it is sometimes a useful idea
to ask them to give any words, phrases or proverbs that they know which are
related to a common word. (eg. ‘friend’).
Responses can be used to build up a word network as shown in the fig. Phrases
and proverbs can be distinguished by using a wavy line while words like synonyms
and antonyms can be linked by dotted lines.
173
Teaching Spelling
Unlike the Indian Languages, English is an unphonetic language i.e., the spelling
and pronunciation do not always correlate. (We write a word but read the word
differently).
Eg.good, blood
The ‘oo’ in these two words are not pronounced the same way. Look at the
‘ea’ in these words.
head, lead (v)
To add to this difficulty, there are letters which become ‘silent’ while
pronouncing the word, but you can’t skip them in spelling.
write, calm, calf, walk, psalm
what is the role of ‘gh’ in daughter?
The letter ‘c’ is not always / si: / it suddenly becomes / k /
Cinema, Cigarette, Cypher, Cyber but what about Cat, Call, Copy, Coffee,
Cup.
Whereas in your mother tongue this difficulty is not there. For each specific
letter there is a specific sound.
For young learners dictation exercises seem to be a night mare. Teacher
says something and expects them to write something else!! ?
While teaching spelling, syllabification of words should form the basis. It is
not counting the letters and splitting up arithmetically for easy memorization.
If we syllabify the word in the way it is spoken, it is easier still to learn the
spelling –
equipment
eq – uip – ment and not eq – ui - pm - ent.
struc – ture and not st – ru – ct – ure.
The best way to learn spelling would be – not drilling nor imposition but
through intuition and constant reading and working out exercises. So teacher
has to think of interesting activities., games and exercises to ward off the fear
of English spelling among the children.
Task 8
Mixed-up Animals
Combine the syllables in the circle to make the names of birds and mammals.
Each syllable may be used once only. You may need more than one syllable to
complete a name.

Paths to spelling success
Spelling games
Now as a teacher you need not struggle to teach spelling. Organise these
activities / games in the classroom and see how your children enjoy the activity
and also learn spelling effortlessly – (without tears!!)
Primary Classes: (At the initial stages)
1. Write what you see:
Teacher writes several words on the black board. Pupils copy certain words
which the teacher underlines or circles one by one: they exchange notebooks
or papers with other pupils for the accuracy of their copying to be checked. (The
teacher does some checking also). Then they cover up what they have written.
The teacher rubs out the words one by one and the pupils write them from
their memory. Then they uncover the hidden words and correct any mistakes,
rewriting mis-spelt words. Finally they exchange books again for a final check
of the correction as the teacher puts the words on the black board again.
2. Write what you hear:
Teacher puts the class into teams and each team makes a list of words. Pupils
choose words from the list with which to challenge one another. One word per
challenger is enough. No word must be given twice. The teacher chooses the
first challenger, who may either come to the front of the class or say the word
from his place. Everyone writes down the word he says. The challenger then
writes the word on the blackboard and also names the next challenger. Pupils
correct their own work or have it corrected by a neighbour.
177
Challengers may come in turn from different teams. The words are written by
all pupils but score is not counted for the challenger’s team.
3. Write what you know
Riddles and definitions lead themselves to vocabulary work; but if they are
very simple and the answer is to be written, it is a matter less of vocabulary
knowledge than of knowing how to spell and this sort of approach to spelling is
meaningful.
The teacher says for example:
1. “The thing we hold over our head when it rains”. The pupils hopefully write
“umbrella” or better “An umbrella”.
2. “Some thing that we wear when it rains” pupils write – ‘A raincoat’.
Further examples:
What has four legs and a back but no head? (A chair)
What do we use to cut meat (A knife)
You can walk or drive along it (A road)
It lives in rivers and has sharp dangerous teeth. (A crocodile)
4. Make words
Younger children particularly enjoy games in which there is a plenty of
movement. Word forming and word completion games can be organised to cater
to this preference.
All the pupils should be given a number of cards - each card bearing a clearly
written letter. Each team can have its own colour of cards. It is not necessary
for every child in a team to have all the letters of the alphabet.
The teacher calls out a word or writes it on the blackboard. It is easier, if the
word is written so that the pupils can look at it and decide whether they can
make the words with the letters they have on cards. Every pupils who has one
of the letters in the word runs to the front and from the word with the other
members of his team. They all hold up their letter cards forming a word and
read it out. The first team ready scores a point.
Sometimes the pupils near the back of the class may never be successful. To
compensate this the teacher distributes the letters of more frequent occurrence
as well as some other letters to the back rows only.
This should certainly be done.
5. Stepping stones
This is for very young learners who have begun reading.
A river is drawn on the floor / black board.
The task is to cross the river by stepping stones. The stones are also drawn in
the ‘river’.
For each stone a word has to be spelt if it is spelt correctly, it is written on the
stone; if not, the team makes no progress.
Words can be given to pupils of different teams in turn.
6. Pattern puzzle: This is better suited to Upper Primary children (VII / VIII) who
are familiar with a lot of words.
Each group is given a card bearing a letter pattern – as shown below. Each
player writes down on paper all the words they can think of, they can use some
178
or all of these letters. But NO letter should be used more than once in any one
word. Also the middle letter (here E) should appear in all the words they make.
Set a time limit. The group or individual with most words is the winner.
From the example given here the following words can be made:
net, nest, nets,
ten, tie, ties, tens,
set, sent, site
7. Word Puzzles
The teacher writes on the blackboard words with ‘ee’ leaving out the other
letters. The clues can be given orally. Children can write the word when someone
has guessed the right answer.
__ __ __ e e __ (a number)
__ e e (insect that gives us honey)
__ e e (another word for ‘look’)
__ __ e e (what mangoes grow on)
__ e e __ (what seven days make)
__ __ e e __ (an animal that give us wool)
__ __ e e __ (what we do at night)
8. Composite pictures
This is an interesting evaluating technique. We can display composite pictures
with several details / items (eg. a beach, a market, etc.)
1. Children look at the picture carefully and write down the names of the
items.
2. Help can be given to children who find the task difficult.
Eg: Write words beginning with ‘c’ / ‘b’ / ‘d’ you see in the picture.
3. For quick learners, this can also be made a little more challenging by
asking them to write any four or five things that they don’t see in the
picture.

Read and Relax:
ENGLISH THE FUNNIEST LANGUAGE
We will begin with BOX and the plural is BOXES.
But the plural OX should be OXEN and not OXES.
Then one fowl is GOOSE but two are GEESE.
Yet the plural of MOUSE should never be MEESE.
You may find a lone MOUSE or a whole set of MICE.
But the plural of HOUSE is HOUSES not HICE.
If plural of MAN be always MEN
Why shouldn’t the plural for PAN be PEN?
If I speak of a FOOT and then you show me your FEET.
And I give a BOOT, would a pair be called BEET?
If one is TOOTH and a whole set are TEETH,
Why shouldn’t the plural of BOOTH be BEETH?
The one may be THAT and three may be THOSE.
Yet HAT in the plural would never be HOSE.
And the plural CAT is CATS not COSE.
We speak of BROTHER and also BRETHEREN.
But though we say MOTHER we never say MOTHEREN.
180
Then the masculine pronouns are HE, HIS and HIM
But imagine the femine SHE, SHIS and SHIM!!
So English, I fancy, you will agree
Is the
FUNNIEST LANGUAGE you ever did see!
- Leo Angela Rupert
PRACTICAL WORK (Practicum)
Prepare a dictionary containing the new words in Std. I to V learning materials.
As a practising teacher – later - you can prepare “Kids’ Wall Dictionary” for the
above classes. You can write the words (a-z) and their meaning (in L1) on
sheets of paper. Paste them on to card boards / calendar pads. Words for each
letter will have one / two pads. Use the same words on different boards for
past tense, singular / plural, degrees of comparison and opposites.
Hang them on the wall on 3 sides of the class. The children should be able to
read words from the hanging ‘dictionary’ sheets.
Apart from knowing the meaning of words, the wall dictionary will help the
children to enjoy doing several interesting activities.
A sample of 20 activities are given below. You can multiply, modify, adapt or
extend them to suit the needs of your children. These activities are compelling.
Children would frequent the wall dictionary to do the activities willingly.

UNIT - 6
TEACHING OF PROSE
SCOPE :
Prose is meant for
learning a language. This unit
consists of eight sections. The
first section deals with
intensive reading. The second
section outlines the aims of
teaching prose. The third
section sums up the steps
involved in teaching prose.
The fourth section
demonstrates the teaching of
a prose lesson. The fifth
section introduces ALM (Active
Learning Methodology). The
sixth section throws light on
extensive reading. The
seventh section talks about
the steps in teaching supplementary reader and the last section gives a vivid
picture of teaching of continuous writing.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTENT :
6.1 PROSE – INTENSIVE READING:
According to Coleridge, “Prose is words in
their best order.”Teaching prose means
teaching reading with comprehension. Having
taught the students how to read a language,
the next logical step is to teach them reading
with comprehension. The main aims of
teaching prose are:
(i) literary, and
(ii) content.
To achieve these aims the teaching of prose
should be intensive as also extensive.
Intensive reading:
Intensive reading or reading for accuracy involves approaching a text under the
close guidance of a teacher, or through a task that forces the student to pay
attention to the text. It involves a profound and detailed understanding of the
OBJECTIVES
To enable the trainees
! to make the students master and
reinforce the structural items.
! to enable the students to acquire new
vocabulary and content words.
! to promote the students’ power of
comprehension through listening and
reading.
! to enhance the students’ capacity of
extracting the information contained in
the lesson.
! to develop the ability of speaking
English correctly and fluently
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
" To enable to the teacher
trainees to identify what
intensive reading is
" To familiarize teacher
trainees with the importance
of intensive reading.
" To encourage their
students to read
intensively.
185
text not only in terms of ‘what’ it says but also ‘how’ it says it. An intensive
reading lesson is primarily concerned with developing reading strategies –
judgement, reasoning, interpretation, appreciation, etc. in the learners.
Generally, a short text, which can be finished
in a lesson or two, is considered suitable for
scanning for information, paying attention to
the writer’s intentions, arguments, ideas, style,
etc. Students while reading a text do not simply
look for any specific piece of information. They
read it thoroughly so that they can pass their
exam which, they know, will contain questions
involving their understanding of the text as a
whole. In all respects, intensive reading is
more an exercise in accuracy. The textbooks
prescribed for General English courses at the
secondary level are all meant to be read
intensively. Students are supposed to read
them in detail so that they can answer the
questions given at the end of each text,
questions on comprehension, grammar,
vocabulary, writing, etc.
The intensive reader should be based on the structural syllabus containing
interesting and well graded reading material accompanied by colourful pictures
to create an interest in the lessons. All reading lessons should be preceded by
plenty of oral discussions in which difficult words, phrases and ideas should be
clearly explained by the teacher. Lessons based on the intensive reader should
have provision for both reading aloud and silent reading, to give the greatest
benefit to a learner of English.
TEACHING INTENSIVE
READER
In dealing with the
intensive Reader in school,
the student is required not
only to comprehend the
lessons, but also to master
the structures and
vocabulary.This can be
achieved through intensive
reading. So intensive
reading forms a very
important aspect of learning
a foreign language
Task :
Choose a short, simple, interesting passage from the text books.
· Allow your students to read the passage by themselves.
· Give them time to understand the passage fully.
· Encourage the students to understand the question and then answer.
A sample passage
A House of leaves :
Little Tara was playing in the park.
A drop of rain fell on her cheek.
‘It’s Gold’, Said Tara.
The second drop fell on her nose.
The third on her hand.
The fourth on her leg.
Before the fifth drop fell on her, she entered a bush.
‘A roof of leaves makes a good shelter’
Tara was happy in the house of leaves.
But Tara was not alone there.
The first guest was the spider.
186
Next came the fluttering butterfly.
The third was a buzzing bee.
The fourth was the creeping worm.
The fifth was the crawling ant.
Finally rushed in, the beetle.
Tara enjoyed the evening.
She was watching her tiny friends.
And when the rain stopped,
She said, ‘Now let’s all go to our real homes’
She moved out of her house of leaves.
And so did the other guests.
Read the sentences below, say whether they are True or False :
Mark (#) for true and (!) for false
1. Little Tara was playing in the park.
2. A leaf fell on the cheek.
3. It started raining
4. She entered her house.
5. Six guests entered the house of leaves.
6. The last guest was the ant.
7. The house of leaves was not their real home.
6.2 AIMS OF TEACHING PROSE:
Teaching of prose is the
intensive study of language,
structures and vocabulary. Its
main objective is to develop the
language ability of the students.
This ability makes the child
understand and use English
language without any problem.
Thus a detailed study
concentrates both on language study and comprehension of ideas or linguistic
skills. The general aims are as follows.
General Aims of Teaching Prose:
To enable the students
i) To understand the passage and grasp its meaning.
ii) To read with correct pronunciation, stress, intonation, pause and articulation
of voice.
iii) To enable students to understand the passage by silent reading.
iv) To enrich their active and passive vocabulary.
v) To express the ideas of the passage orally and in writing.
vi) To enjoy reading and writing.
vii) To develop their imagination.
viii)To prepare the students for world citizenship.
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
To enable the teacher trainees
" to acquaint with the general and
specific aims of teaching prose.
" to help the students achieve those aims.
187
Specific Aims
These vary according to the subject – matter depending upon whether it is a
story, biography, play or an essay.
For these the specific aims are as follows:
Story
i) To enable the students to learn a few facts through the story.
ii) To teach some morals through the story.
iii) To mould students’ character.
iv) To acquaint students with the style of story writing.
Essay
i) To enable the students to grasp a few facts through the essay.
ii) To make students curious about subject of the essay.
iii) To acquaint students with the style of essay – writing.
iv) To enable students to arrange ideas in a systematic way.
Biography
i) To get students acquainted with the lives and deeds of great men.
ii) To reveal to the students the path of character building.
iii) To make them aspire for better things in life.
iv) To inculcate in them desirable sentiments.
Play
i) To provide the students with opportunities for self–expression.
ii) To make them speak English in the conversational style.
iii) To make them play different roles.
iv) To build their character.
6.3 THE STEPS INVOLVED IN TEACHING PROSE:
A prose lesson contains
structures, vocabulary and ideas
for comprehension. The
students must have a mastery
over the sounds, structure and
vocabulary before reading the
passage / lesson. The main
objective of teaching prose is to
help the students use the
structures and vocabulary he
can read with comprehension
and write a few sentences
about the lesson using the
appropriate structures and
content words. Therefore a prose lesson is not for memorizing questions and
answers but for learning a language. The steps for teaching of prose may be
summed up as follows.
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:
To enable the teacher trainees
" to be aware of the steps to be
followed in teaching prose.
" to realize the significance of each and
every step.
" to inspire them to follow the same
steps in their classroom practice
188
1. Introducing the prose lesson
The Introduction has two purposes:
i) to bring the past knowledge to consciousness.
ii) to win students’ attention to the new subject.
English is a foreign language and Indian students find it difficult. So, teachers
should try to motivate students to study the lesson. All the efforts made by the
teacher to attract students to learn the lesson is known as ‘preparation of the
lesson’. It includes the material aids, previous knowledge of the students and
introduction.
The teacher can introduce the lesson through appropriate questions or through
showing pictures, models etc. However, he should not start the topic directly.
The introductory questions arouse curiosity among the students for the new lesson.
Hence the teacher should first ask some questions to test the previous knowledge
of the students and then link that to the subject to be taught.
2. Teaching structures:
When presenting a new structural item, we should primarily achieve two things:
a) To enable the students to identify the new structures.
b) To make absolutely clear its meaning and use.
To achieve (a) above, the teacher must supply clear models of the structure.
Some believe that plenty of examples should be given bringing the pattern out
clearly. In this connection substitution table is of great help as it highlights the
elements of the pattern and their order and nature.
One of the ways of achieving (b) is to present the structure in readily
understandable situations. This helps the students not only to understand the
meaning of the new item but also its use in different contexts. Later they are
provided with opportunities to use the structures themselves.
3. Dividing the text into smaller units
Reading passages sometimes happen to be very long making it tiresome to work
through them from beginning to end. In such a case the text will have to be split
up into shorter, more manageable units or sections. This will facilitate the
teacher to present the lesson before the students interestingly and efficiently.
4. Teaching Vocabulary:
The teacher selects the new words from the subtopic and exposes their meaning
one after the other. To give clear ideas to students he may use an object, a model
or a picture. Sometimes through situation he may explain the meaning.
The purposes of exposition are:
(i) To clear the meaning of difficult words, phrases and Idioms.
(ii) To make the comprehension of the passage easy.
(iii) To pave way for intensive reading.
189
5. Model Reading by the Teacher:
In this step, the teacher should read out his selected passage loudly before the
students. At the time of reading he/she should be very careful about the
pronunciation, words, phrases and intonation. Since the students learn to read
through imitation the teacher should take the utmost pains to improve his/her
own reading aloud.
This model reading helps the students for aural comprehension. Before doing
model reading, the teacher should give instructions to students regarding postures,
opening of the book and attention. While reading he should not completely absorb
himself in the book.
6. Silent Reading by the students:
Here the teacher gives time for the students to read the passage silently. Such
type of reading is helpful for rapid reading, learning of new words and a quick
grasp of meaning. Silent reading should continue for a limited time, say for five
or ten minutes for a single passage.
7. Testing comprehension:
In this step the teacher asks some questions from the present passage to the
students to test to what extent the students have comprehended the meaning of
the passage.
These questions should be based on the very passage taught by the teacher and
they should be direct, short and objective based.
 The same procedure (steps 4,5,6,7) can be followed for rest of the lesson.
8. Testing application:
The main aim of application test is to evaluate to what extent the objectives of a
lesson have been achieved. The questions may be of oral or written type.
After the teaching of structure or vocabulary teaching, the teacher normally asks
the students to do the exercises at the end of the lesson.
9. Loud reading by the students
Now is the time when the teacher can ask the students to read out the passage
loudly one by one.
This loud reading is very much helpful to the students for clear pronunciation. It
also improves the tone, rhythm and fluency. But a student should not read a long
passage. Each student should read a few lines from the passage.
In this regard the following points can be given special consideration.
$ The errors of pronunciation must be corrected at the end of the reading.
$ Students should be asked to keep the books 30 cm away from the eyes.
$ They should hold the book in the left hand while the right hand should
be kept free.
190
The teacher will therefore need to exercise great care whenever the students
are asked to read aloud. As the students have already learnt all the new words,
structures and as they have also understood the text, the chances for success in
reading aloud are greater than they are at the beginning.
10. Giving Assignment:
After the classroom tasks are completed the teacher can give some assignments which
could be of the following types:
i) To remember the meaning and spelling of new words.
ii) To use the words in sentences.
iii)To write the gist of the passage.
iv)To answer questions on the passage.
v) To do the exercises based on the structures taught.
 Task: (i)
The initial exercises for silent reading can be a set of instructions to be read and
followed by students. To develop the skill of silent reading you can try this.
Example: Read the sentences fast. Do what each sentence asks you to do.
Drawing a girl:
i) Draw the head.
ii) Draw the neck.
iii) Draw the skirt.
iv) Draw the legs.
v) Draw the hands.
vi) Bring me your picture.
The students who draw the picture first are supposed to have read the six
sentences fast and also understood them.
 Task: (ii)
Comprehension is one of the chief aims of teaching prose. This task is to
 test your level of comprehension.
Read the passage below and answer the questions.
Dear Raj,
I was happy to get your letter as we haven’t heard from you for six months. I hope
your stomach is better now. How is your work at the hospital? Do you do many
operations every day?
As you know, our parents are touring in Singapore now. They have always wanted
to go there, haven’t they? They’ll be back in two weeks’ time, I think.
I got my results last week and I have secured the first place in the university. I start
work next month and I hope my students will be good, too.
Tomorrow is New year’s Day and I am sitting in our house and writing this letter.
Do write soon.
Love
 Jeevan

% List out the assignments that you can give after teaching the lesson.
6.4 PLANNING A PROSE LESSON –MODEL:
A Sample Lesson Plan
Standard : VI / English / prose
Title : The young achiever
(unit – IV)
Time : 135 minutes
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:
To enable the teacher trainees
" to familiarize themselves with
the steps to be followed in
planning a prose lesson .
" to get practice in writing a lesson
plan.
i) 45 minutes - for teaching structures
ii) 45 minutes - for teaching the first sub-unit
iii) 45 minutes - for teaching the second sub-unit
Note : You need to prepare a separate lesson plan for teaching
structures.
This lesson plan deals with the teaching of the text. An effective way of making
the prose lesson easy for the learner is to divide the text into smaller sub-units
and deal with a sub-unit thoroughly.
Eg: Sub-unit I : From : Some are born …………….
To : ……………….across the world.
Sub-unit II : From : Kutraleeswaran swam across……….
To : …………………...an Indian to the core.
192
Defining Competencies:
i) Listening to the teacher’s instructions and carrying them out.
ii) Scanning a text for specific information.
iii) Writing a parallel paragraph.
Motivation:
i) Motivate the students by asking simple questions.
ii) Show the picture of Kutraleeswaran and give a very short introduction
 about him.
Teaching Learning Materials:
Pictures, flash cards, letter cards and blackboard.
Step -1
Select the new words and other hard words in sub-unit I. Teach the vocabulary
items first; achieve, greatness, thrust, debut, hailed, prodigy, created, participated
are the new words in the first sub-unit. Teach the new words through pictures,
gestures and situations.
Step- 2
Read out the sub-unit I (as divided above).
Let the students follow your reading. Read out the unit again.
This time you stop at a particular place.
Ask a child to continue.
Skip a word or two while reading.
Students would point out.
These measures will ensure that the students are closely following your
reading.
Step -3
 After reading out the text twice fix time limit for the students to read the text
 silently.
Go round the class.
Ensure that the students do not
- sub vocalize. (humming the word)
- regress (going back on the same sentence)
- run their fingers under the line.
Step - 4
After the students finish reading the unit ask them a number of short and
simple questions from the passage.
It is not necessary that you have to ask the same questions given at the end of
the lesson.
Frame a simple question for each idea conveyed in the passage.
This is to test the comprehension.
193
Example : From the first paragraph of the first sub-unit you can ask the
 following questions :
1. Who are the two youngsters mentioned in the lesson?
2. At what age did Sachin Tendulkar enter the circket field?
3. Which is the native place of Sachin Tendulkar?
4. Who is called a child prodigy?
5. Which is the native place of Kutraleeswaran?
6. When was Kutraleeswaran born?
Step – 5
Ask the students to read the passage loudly one by one. Give opportunity to all
the students. If the students make mistakes while reading, correct their mistakes
after their reading is over.
Loud reading will give a sense of satisfaction to the students and will increase
their confidence.
You can follow the same procedure for the second subunit also.
Step - 6
You can evaluate the students in various ways :
Eg:
a) Give the meaning of the following: (flash cards can be used)
achieve -
debut -
hailed -
prodigy -
performance -
b) Rearrange the letters to form the words. (letter cards can be used)
i) r e h a c i v e
ii) r p e s v a e n e c r e
iii) t r s h u t
iv) g n r e t a e s s
v) e r o c
c) Make the students do the exercises I a, I b (P.No. 71) and II (P.No. 72) of
 the book for class VI.
Step - 7
You can give home work related to the lesson.
Eg:
Consult your friends. Collect at least two more pieces of information about
Kutraleesaran and write them down.
Note : Steps numbered above can be labelled as per instructions for lesson plan
introduced in teaching of all subjects.
194
Activity Based Learning:
Activity Based Learning is a new ladder
approach in teaching of English Language.
This system of learning, not only simplifies
the process of teaching and learning but
also makes it more logical and natural.
Learning involves listening, speaking,
reading and writing. Negligence of any one
of the four skills of learning will result in
irreparable damage to the learning process.
Separate logos are assigned for each
learning activity. Names of vehicles are
selected as Logos for English. These Logos
are distributed in the milestones.
No teacher can skip any step as he/she is forced to go by the steps, stated in the
ladder. Evaluation is a continuous process. This method is followed at primary
level in Tamil Nadu. There is provision for the fast learners to go fast at their own
speed. The slow learners without any hindrance can proceed at their own pace.
Active Learning Methodology
Active Learning Methodology is followed at upper primary level in Tamil Nadu. It
is also a form of activity based learning. The main objective of this method is to
make all the students participate in learning. In this method the students involve
in reading, writing, speaking, drawing, sharing, expressing the skills and
questioning individually and in groups. For more details with respect to Activity
Based Learning and Active Learning Methodology refer to unit –IV
To provide you with some information regarding the teaching through active learning
methodology a sample lesson plan is given in this section.
A sample lesson plan based on Active Learning Methodology:
Topic : Adverbials of time Subject : English Grammar
Standard : VI Unit : II Section ‘C’
Nature of the Topic : Ink-blot Technique : Chalk & Talk
Time : 90 mts.
Introduction :
The teacher successfully exploits the class-room situation by asking the students
to do some action like holding tight, walking, reading etc., Then she asks them
deliberately to do the actions in the way she guides them. (For eg: She asks the
students to hold tight, to walk in slow steps, to read aloud) Now she writes on the
board.
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:
To enable the teacher trainees
" to orient the trainees with the
learning methods such as
Activity Based Learning and
Active Learning Methodology.
" to practise the steps followed
in Active Learning Methodology
through illustration.
TASK:
 Design some innovative activities to teach vocabulary.
EVALUATION :
Choose a grammatical item from the reader of standard – VI and write a lesson plan.
6.5 ALTERNATIVE LEARNING METHOD FOR PROSE LESSON:
195
Eg : She walks slowly, He holds firmly Rani reads loudly
V Adv V Adv V Adv
The teacher asks them what actions are done by their friends. Hearing the
answers, the teacher circles the verb. Then she asks them how the action is
done and she underlines the words which show how the action is done. It denotes
the manner of action.
Finally she concludes that the word that shows how the action is done is an
adverb. Adverbial of Time – It denotes the time of action.
She continues eliciting answers from the students by asking the following
questions.
$ When did you go to cinema?
$ When do we celebrate our Independence Day?
$ When do you have your Quarterly exams?
$ When is Uma coming from Madurai?
$ When do you have your English Class?
The Student’s answers will be
$ I went to cinema last week.
$ We celebrate it on August 15th.
$ We have our Quarterly exams by next month.
$ She is coming tomorrow.
$ We have our English class daily.
The teacher gives a turn to the students and asks them to circle the verb and to
underline the word which shows time. Now the teacher concludes that the words
which show when an action takes place are called adverbs of time.
Understanding :
The teacher gives further examples and asks the students to underline the adverbs
of time.
Summarizing : Notes
Adverbs of time show when the action takes place.
Example :
I come to school daily
I met my friend yesterday
I have to go home before 6.00 p.m.
Mind Mapping
The teacher asks the students
to prepare mind maps and to
present them in small
groups. The teacher
herself shows her mind map
196
Cues : already, next month, last week, soon, never, a year ago, an hour ago,
before.
Discussion : (in large group)
Based on the introduction, understanding and mind mapping the children sit in
large groups, discuss and pick out the words that show time adverbials from the
text book of Std. VI (Page no.22 – 24)
Writing :
The time adverbials picked out from the text book are written in the notebooks.
If possible they can construct new sentences using the time – adverbials.
Activity : 1
Choose the adverbs of time from the piggie – bank and complete the sentences.
1. Ram left home ………………………..
2. Latha met her class – mates …………………..
3. Varun arrives …………………………..

the back of the elephant, which is driven and guided by the driver, called the
mahout, who squats on its neck. In this way the hunters are carried through the
thickest, and at such a height that they can see and fire at the tiger when it is
driven out.
In old days elephants were used in battles, and all Indian Rajas had their regiments
of trained fighting elephants. And they still have their place in state processions,
when they are painted with bright colours and covered with silk and velvet clothes.
In Africa elephants are hunted mainly for their tusks, which are made of ivory
and are very valuable. Their skins are so thick that an ordinary bullet will not
pierce them; and so large guns, called elephant-guns, are used to kill the animals.
Many elephants are caught alive to be tamed and trained. But catching elephants
alive is difficult and dangerous work; though the elephant is a shy, wild animal
when left alone. It can be a dangerous enemy when attacked. Elephants are
generally caught alive in great traps or enclosures, called Keddahs. They are
either driven into these keddahs, or led into them by tame elephants, called
decoys, which are trained to lead their wild brothers into captivity.
Task: (i)
Read the passage and carry out the instructions below :
THE ELEPHANT
Now that the mammoth is extinct, the elephant is the largest of all animals
living, and the strongest. It is a strange-looking animal, with its thick legs, huge
sides and back, large hanging ears, small tail, little eyes, long white tusks, and
above all, its long nose, called the trunk. The trunk is the elephant’s peculiar
feature, and it puts it to various uses. It draws up water by its trunk, and can
squirt it all over its body like a shower bath; and with it, it picks leaves from the
trees and puts them into its mouth. In fact, its trunk serves the elephant as a
long arm and hand. Elephants look very clumsy and heavy, and yet they can move
very quickly when they like.
Elephants are found in India and in Africa. The African elephant differs in some
points from the Indian, being larger, with longer tusks and bigger ears. In fact the
two are considered to be different species. In both countries, they live in herds in
the jungles, and are naturally shy animals that keep away from men. Elephants,
with their great size and strength, are fine advertisement for vegetarianism, for
they live entirely on leaves of trees, grass, roots and bulbs.
The elephant is a very intelligent animal, and its intelligence combined with its
great strength, makes it, when tamed, a very useful servant to man; and it has
been trained to serve in various ways.
Elephants can carry heavy loads about a thousand seers each; and they are used
to draw heavy wagons and big guns that would require many horses. They are
very skilful, too, in piling timber. The trained elephant will kneel down, lift a
heavy log of wood with its tusks, carry it to the place where it is wanted, and lay
it exactly in position.
Elephants are also trained for tiger-hunting. The huntsmen sit in the howdah on
199
Extensive reading or reading
for fluency involves reading of
longer texts for pleasure and,
not necessarily, for minute
details. It is a fluency
activity in which the students
can read on their own. It is
also called ‘Rapid Reading’ or
‘Independent Silent Reading’.
SPECIFIC OBJECITVES:
To enable the students
" To grasp the meaning as quickly as
possible .
" To increase passive vocabulary.
" To develop a taste for reading.
" To inculcate a habit of reading for
pleasure and profit.
" To concentrate upon subject matter.
Instructions :
1. Reading silently and aloud. Understanding (Don’t hurry, Take atleast 10
minutes)
a) Read silently in your mind, Are you able to picture what the passage
is talking about?
b) If there are any unfamiliar or new words, mark them out, find out
the meanings. Write them down.
c) Highlight or underline words or phrases or sentences that seem
important to you to understand the passage.
d) Read again. Have you understood the article ? What questions does
it raise? Note them down.
2. Make a colourful mind map using the main points from the passage (You
may take 10 minutes)
3. Sharing, Verifying, Summarising (20 minutes)
In mixed groups of three or four discuss : What is the author trying to
convey? What interested you about the article? How do you know you have
understood what has been said? Put this together in a summary.
4. Individual written work. Now, use your mind map to answer questions on
the passage. If your mind map is complete, you will be able to answer the
questions well.
5. In a large group : Present the mind map or summary. Raise questions.
Share any new insights.
 Task (ii)
 Visit primary and upper primary schools.
Observe how Activity Based Learning and Active Learning Methodology are followed.
Observe how the students react when they are taught through these methods.
Prepare a report listing out the merits of Activity Based Learning and Active
Learning Methodology.
EVALUATION :
% Choose a prose lesson from the textbook of standard VI or VII
% Use your imagination and prepare a mind map
6.6 EXTENSIVE READING :
200
Class time is short and the amount of reading normally is very great in our school
curriculum. A good school library would be an ideal place for students to enjoy
reading. But wherever library facilities are available, students should be
encouraged to read on their own, and where no such facility is available, the
teacher should refer to a list of books that students could be asked to read at
home.
Extensive reading means
a) to read silently and quickly.
b) to understand the subject matter as quickly and efficiently as possible.
c) to read without the help of the teacher.
d) to read pass words into passive vocabulary.
Extensive reading can play a vital role in the learning of a second / foreign
language. In this regard, the following characteristics are very important.
i) Students read as much as possible both inside the classroom and outside.
ii) Students have a choice and freedom to select whatever they want to read.
They can stop reading the texts which do not interest them.
iii) Reading has its own reward. There are no follow up activities or tasks.
iv) The reading texts are within the linguistic competence of the reader.
v) Students read at their own pace. They choose when to read and where to
read. This helps them develop fluency as they learn to read faster and
without disturbance.
Procedure for Extensive Reading:
The exact procedure advisable to adopt will depend upon the nature of the subject
matter to be read and the skill in reading already acquired by the class.
Following are the main steps in extensive reading.
i) Introduction:
For the purpose of introduction, the teacher should
(a) give main hints of the passage,
(b) briefly explain the difficult portions, and
(c) deal with special difficulties of the language.
ii) Silent Reading:
In this the students should read silently but quickly.
iii) Questions:
To test the students the teacher asks a few questions.
In following the procedure of extensive reading it is desirable to have the
following two points in mind.
i) The matter read must be understood by readers in order to increase
interest, and
ii) The matter should be read silently, otherwise interest will flag.
Extensive Reading can provide a better exposure to English through a wide variety
of materials. Generally, students find their school textbooks uninteresting and
de-motivating. It is imperative that extensive materials are easy, appealing, varied
and, above all, authentic. Authentic texts refer to the texts which students come
201
across in daily life and which they will want to read after they exit their educational
institutions. In this behalf, a newspaper or a magazine will be more relevant to
students.
The decisions with regard to when to introduce authentic texts will depend on
the level of linguistic competence the students have reached at a particular point
of time. If a student’s proficiency is below the required level, problems are bound
to arise. Independent silent reading will require a sufficient command of language
to comprehend and understand the message in the text.
What is the difference between intensive reading and extensive reading?
In Intensive reading, a child learns to read; in Extensive reading, a
child practises what he has learnt.
Extensive Reading Advantages:
i) It helps in assimilation of ideas.
ii) It keeps the whole class busy and active.
iii) It increases vocabulary.
iv) It has high ‘Transfer of learning’ value, since it prepares students for library
 reading.
v) It paves the path for individual method of study and self – education.
Task :
Provide the students with some good story books. Ask them to fill up the
banners after they complete the story. Give them stars to encourage reading.

6.7 STEPS IN TEAHING SUPPLEMENTARY READER:
Students learn to read through reading. A Supplementary Reader aims to give
students additional practice in reading so that they may

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:
To make the teacher trainees
" Familiar with the steps in teaching
supplementary reader.
" Practice the steps in their regular
classrooms.
" Create an interest among the students
in reading more.
% increase their reading
speed,
% develop desirable silent
reading skills,
% learn to guess the meanings
of some words from the
context in which they have
been used,
% grasp the central idea of
the passage read,
% follow the sequence of ideas,
events etc. in the passage,
% (at a later stage, say at high school stage) learn to use reading techniques
like skimming in different contexts,
% extend their reading experience,
% extend their vocabulary,
% consolidate the language learnt through the main Reader, and
% enjoy reading.
While the Reader contains short passages packed with structural and vocabulary
items, those in the Supplementary Reader are long and contain language that
the students are familiar with, but packed with information which they enjoy
reading.
The Supplementary Reader – The content.
A Supplementary Reader usually contains stories for classes VI and VII. At the
later stages other types, namely biographies, historical events etc. are also
included.
The language used in the first half of the reading passages / lessons will be
limited to the items (sentences + vocabulary) taught/learnt in the previous class,
while the later half will include the early items taught/learnt in the class for
203
which the Supplementary Reader is meant. Occasionally there may be some
new words. Such new words are either glossed or left unexplained for the students
to guess their meaning. Each reading passage has a picture or two, to make
students realize what the passage is about, followed by a set of comprehension
questions for discussion and also to help students to acquire different reading
skills.
Do’s and Don’ts in dealing with a Supplementary Reader
1. Do the Supplementary Reader in class.
2. Set apart one full period for each lesson/story.
3. Let students read and understand as much as they can and acquire
independent reading habits.
4. Don’t read out the passage in the classroom .
5. Don’t explain the content of the Supplementary Reader passage.
6. Don’t translate any part of it.
7. Don’t hesitate to bring to the class any picture which you think will
supplement the existing illustration(s) in the reading passage.
How to teach a Supplementary Reader lesson?
The following steps are suggested for teaching a lesson in the Supplementary
Reader –a story or a chapter of a long story/novel etc.
% Introduce the passage briefly.
% Narrate a part of the passage to kindle interest.
% If you identify any difficult word(s) in the passage that may hinder
comprehension, teach it (them) as quickly as you can (using the mother
tongue equivalent if necessary) and write it (them) on the blackboard.
% Write on the blackboard some pre–reading questions (framed by the teacher
or those given at the end of the passage). This step is optional.
% Ask students to read the passage silently
% Check comprehension through questions/discussions. If possible let the
students form groups and discuss before answering questions. One of the
members of the group may answer followed by the others in chorus. The
teacher should guide the students during their discussion so that they can
speak in English. This kind of group activity is possible if the answers to
some questions are not explicitly stated in the passage. Different types of
questions –global and local, direct/factual, inferential, interpretative and
evaluative –are possible besides the usual objective type of questions.
% Occasionally get students to retell part(s) of the story/passage. This is a
good opportunity for the teacher/students to practice use of language in
speech also based on their reading.
% Ask the students to write the answers to comprehension questions at home.
% Select some suitable passages for language study. This activity must be
taken up in the class to consolidate the language points already taught/
learnt in the earlier periods.
204
The main or detailed Reader is read intensively in class to learn the language –
sentence patterns and vocabulary besides some useful information. The
Supplementary Reader is not read intensively or in detail but the reading is an
activity done in the class with some help from the teacher, followed by some
testing of reading comprehension.
Contrary to the intensive reading done in class, extensive reading is ‘wide’ reading
done individually. Each student reads something different. The objective is to
encourage students to read as much as they can.
Evaluation:
Write a lesson plan for the story “Rip Van Winkle – Chapter – I’ from the
Supplementary Reader of Standard VII based on the steps mentioned in the unit.
6.8 TEACHING CONTINUOUS WRITING
When we learn a second
language, we learn to
communicate with other
people in order to (a)
understand them, (b) to speak/
talk to them, (c) to read what
they have written and (d) to
write to them. Writing involves
(i) the ability to master the
shapes of the letters of the
alphabet (Ortho Graphics), (ii)
knowledge of the right
combination of letters to form
words (spelling), and (iii) skill
in expressing one self through
the written piece.
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
To enable the trainees
" To give writing practice to the students;
" To help the students think freely;
" To enable the students to express themselves
systematically;
" To enable the students to organize the
facts logically;
" To develop the imagination of the students.
To facilitate the students to communicate through writing, they must be motivated
to write continuously. This can be accomplished by exercises like writing about
themselves, their every day experiences, story writing, discribing an event,
paragraph writing etc. The students must learn to write short sentences before
they learn to write a paragraph. If they learn how to join words to form sentences
they will be well on the way to writing composition correctly.
Beginning writing :-
The first real writing that students do is copying. It is important to give them
plenty of practice in writing clearly and accurately. The words and sentences
that are written in these early stages are usually ones that have been spoken,
heard and read. The following activities can be used to encourage writing.
Task - 1 Copying:
The teacher introduces the words / sentences orally and the students
repeat it. The teacher writes it on the black board. The students read it a
number of times. Then they copy it.
205
 Task - 2 Board Composition :
This follows a similar pattern except that a student builds up a sentence for
which the teacher helps either through question or prompts. The teacher writes
this on the board and then proceeds as before.
 Task - 3 Completion with choice
The student completes the sentences on the board by choosing the items from
the list
Oranges
I like eating _______ Meat
Bananas
Bread
 Task - 4 Completing the Paragraph
This is usually combined with a short reading exercise and oral work. After
oral preparation, the teacher writes a few sentences on the board.
‘Mary lives in Delhi. She lives with her father and mother. Her brother,
Peter, lives in Bombay’.
Underneath the teacher writes sentences that have to be copied out, using
information from the passage.
1. Mary lives in Delhi with her ……….. and ………
2. Her brother’s name is ………
3. Peter ………….. in Bombay
 Task - 5 Sentence Tables
The sentence tables that are given can allow greater choice and lead to the
construction of more complicated sentences.
Saravanan playing
When Malini had finished eating
I sleeping
it was time to go to temple he
market When She
I
got there it was ………………………………….
206
 Task - 6 Parallel Composition
The teacher gives a piece and the class copies it. The teacher then requires the
class to make a few changes here and there and to prepare a parallel paragraph
on similar topic.
Example : -
‘This is Ravi. He is ten years old. He is in class V in Nehru School. There are
thirty students in his class. His teacher likes him because he is good at
everything. etc.., etc..,’
The students can be asked to copy the piece beginning it with
‘This is Usha. She is ……………………………………………………………………
………………………………………………………………………………..’
 Task - 7 Parallel composition using pictures
The teacher can show a picture of a pet dog along with description and asks
the class to write a description for the picture of a cat.
1. This is Jimmy.
2. This is my pet animal
3. It eats biscuits everyday
4. It guards our house
5. I love Jimmy very much.
1. …………………………………………..
2. …………………………………………..
3. …………………………………………..
4. …………………………………………..
5. …………………………………………..
207
 Task - 8 Fill in the blanks
The teacher writes on the black board sentences with a number of words missing.
To make it easier, the teacher may supply as list of words from which the blanks
can be filled:
The list contains the words that are suitable as well as those that are not required.
So children have to think twice before completing the exercise.
 Task - 9 Picture Composititon
The teacher supplies the students with series of pictures with sentences under
each. Students look at the pictures and sentences and complete the story.
Example
1. They played 2. He threw the ball 3. He caught it.
4. Then he threw it back 5. He did not catch it. 6. He ran after the ball.
7. He did not see the stone 8. He fell over it.
208
Now write this story:
David and Charles (1)...... David (2) ….. and Charles (3)……… then Charles
(4) ……. But David (5) ...... So he (6)….. But (7) …… and so (8)........
Writing Paragraphs:
After children have gained fluency in writing sentences, they should be helped to
write paragraphs. A paragraph usually consists of a topic sentence followed by a
number of related sentences and usually ends in a concluding statement.

Topic Sentence
What is the topic sentence?
The topic sentence is the most important sentence in a paragraph that sums
up the whole idea / theme of the paragraph. It may be in the beginning, middle
or at the end of the paragraph.
What does it do?
It introduces the main idea of the paragraph.
How do I write one?
Summarize the main idea of your paragraph. Indicate to the reader what your
paragraph will be about.

have access to medical services at a reasonable price. Second, Canada has a
high standard of education. Students are taught by well-trained teachers
and are encouraged to continue studying at university. Finally, Canada's
cities are clean and efficiently managed. Canadian cities have many parks
and lots of space for people to live. As a result, Canada is a desirable place
to live.
209

They come after the topic sentence, making up the body of a paragraph.
What do they do?
They give details to develop and support the main idea of the paragraph.
How do I write them?
You should give supporting facts, details, and examples.

to medical services at a reasonable price. Second, it has a high standard of
education. Students are taught by well-trained teachers and are encouraged
to continue studying at university. Finally, its cities are clean and efficiently
managed. Its cities have many parks and lots of space for people to live. As
a result, it is a desirable place to live.
Closing Sentence
What is the closing sentence?
The closing sentence is the last sentence in a paragraph.
What does it do?
It restates the main idea of your paragraph.
How do I write one?
Restate the main idea of the paragraph using different words.

world. First, the country has an excellent health care system. All Canadians
have access to medical services at a reasonable price. Second, it has a high
standard of education. Students are taught by well-trained teachers and are
encouraged to continue studying at university. Finally, Its cities are clean
and efficiently managed. They have many parks and lots of space for people
to live. As a result, it is a desirable place to live.
Prewriting Paragraphs
What is the prewriting stage?
The prewriting stage is when you think carefully and organize your ideas for
your paragraph before you begin writing.
Six Prewriting Steps:
1. Think carefully about what you are going to write. Ask yourself: What
question am I going to answer in this paragraph or essay? How can I best
answer this question? What is the most important part of my answer? How
can I make an introductory sentence (or thesis statement) from the most
important part of my answer? What facts or ideas can I use to support my
introductory sentence? How can I make this paragraph or essay interesting?
Do I need more facts on this topic? Where can I find more facts on this topic?
2. Open your notebook. Write out your answers to the above questions. You
do not need to spend a lot of time doing this; just write enough to help you
remember why and how you are going to write your paragraph or essay.
210
3. Collect facts related to your paragraph or essay topic. Look for and write
down facts that will help you to answer your question. Timesaving hint:
make sure the facts you are writing are related to the exact question you
are going to answer in your paragraph or essay.
4. Write down your own ideas. Ask yourself: What else do I want to say about
this topic? Why should people be interested in this topic? Why is this topic
important?
5. Find the main idea of your paragraph or essay. Choose the most important
point you are going to present. If you cannot decide which point is the most
important, just choose one point and stick to it throughout your paragraph
or essay.
6. Organize your facts and ideas in a way that develops your main idea.
Once you have chosen the most important point of your paragraph or essay,
you must find the best way to tell your reader about it. Look at the facts you
have written. Look at your own ideas on the topic. Decide which facts and
ideas will best support the main idea of your paragraph. Once you have
chosen the facts and ideas you plan to use, ask yourself which order to put
them in the paragraph. Write down your own note set that you can use to
guide yourself as you write your paragraph or essay.
Writing Paragraphs
What is the writing stage?
The writing stage is when you turn your ideas into sentences.
Five Writing Steps:
1. Open your notebook and word processor.
2. Write the topic sentence, supporting sentences, and closing sentence.
3. Write clear and simple sentences to express your meaning.
4. Focus on the main idea of your paragraph.
5. Use the dictionary to help you find additional words to express your ideas.
Editing Paragraphs
What is the editing stage?
The editing stage is when you check your paragraph for mistakes and correct
them.
Grammar and Spelling
1. Check your spelling.
2. Check your grammar.
3. Read your essay again.
4. Make sure each sentence has a subject.
5. See if your subjects and verbs agree with each other.
6. Check the verb tenses of each sentence.
7. Make sure that each sentence makes sense.
Style and Organization
1. Make sure your paragraph has a topic sentence.
2. Make sure your supporting sentences focus on the main idea.
3. Make sure you have a closing sentence.
211
4. Check that all your sentences focus on the main idea.
5. See if your paragraph is interesting.
Finalising Paragraphs
What is the finalising stage?
The publishing stage is when you produce a final copy of your paragraph to
hand in.
Three Finalising Steps:
1. Make a paper copy of your paragraph.
2. Show your work to your teacher, tutor, or parents.
3. Ask them for hints on how to improve your writing.
a. Definition Paragraph

Example: A pest is defined as any animal or plant that damages crops, forests,
or property.
2. "is a kind of"
Example: A pest is a kind of animal or plant that damages crops, forests, or
property.
b. Sequence Paragraph

Evaluation:
Write down your impressions of the first visit to a primary school in a paragraph.
Summing up:
$ Teaching of prose means teaching reading with comprehension.
$ The Intensive reader is based on the structural patterns, syllabus and
vocabulary.
$ The lessons in the intensive reader have provision for both silent reading
and oral reading.
$ To enable the students to understand the passage, to read fluently, to
enrich their vocabulary and to enjoy reading and writing are the major
aims of teaching prose.
$ The objective of teaching prose is to enable the learners to extend their
knowledge of vocabulary and structures and to become more proficient in
the four language skills.
$ The actual method of teaching a lesson will depend, among other things, on
pupil attainment.
$ Situational presentation of new items brings out their meaning and use.
$ Defining competency, motivation, teaching learning materials, teaching
learning activities, reinforcement activities, evaluation and follow – up are
the steps generally followed in preparing a lesson – plan.
$ Activity Based Learning and Active Learning Methodology are the methods
in practice at present at primary and upper primary levels respectively.
$ Introduction, Guided Reading, Mind map, Consolidation, Enrichment Activity,
Assessment, Writing and Remedial measure are the steps followed in
teaching through Active Learning Methodology.
$ In extensive reading a child practices reading. It is also called ‘rapid reading’
or independent silent reading.
214
$ Prescribed books have very little reading matter. So supplementary reading
material is necessary.
$ Supplementary reading helps consolidate language items already learnt.
$ Supplementary reading also helps in developing reading speed and fosters
a love for reading in general.
$ A paragraph usually consists of a topic sentence followed by a number of
related sentences and usually ends in a concluding statement.
Exploration:
$ Look at the following words:
Handsome, pretty, lovely, beautiful, attractive, good-looking
Did you notice that these words are used to describe the appearance of
persons and things? We need to be a little careful, however, when we use
these words. Use a dictionary and write the nouns that go with these
adjectives.
****
$ Vocabulary teaching is one of the steps in teaching of a prose lesson. A
word used out of context or a wrong word used in a certain context can
cause misinterpretation and confusion.
Differentiate between the following:
appreciate - appreciable
disinterested - uninterested
each other - one another
questionable - questioning
rise - raise
majority - plurality
****
$ Read the words given in clusters carefully. Use these words in sentences
of your own bringing out the differences in the shade of meaning. You may
have to use a dictionary or a thesaurus.
a) broad / large /big /huge / vast /tall /high /long /lengthy / maximum.
b) small /tiny / puny / short / low /concise / minimum /little /
miniature / slight / mini / minor.
Make an attempt to prepare clusters like these.
****
$ Think of any continuous writing you have read recently. It may be a news
report, a story, a commentary or a review. All these come under prose as
against poems. Poems are expressions of feelings, joy or sorrow presented
in acknowledge forms or stanzas. Prose writing is easier than poetry making.
Do you agree with the steps of teaching prose? Can you make changes in
the order of these steps? What makes you suggest such changes? What do
you think will be the effect of these changes in the learners? Should there
be a strict order of steps? Why do you think so?
****
$ Look at the step-6 under planning a prose lesson in sub-topic-4. Two ways
of evaluating the students are suggested. Explore some more ways of
evaluating the students while teaching a prose lesson.
****
$ Collect different kinds of paragraphs mentioned in the unit from various
books and journals.

UNIT – 7
TEACHING OF POETRY
Poetry begins in delight and ends in wisdom
- Robert Frost
SCOPE
Literature is an art. The highest form of literary expression is poetry. It is a
work of perfect art and beauty. It is an art because it appeals to the emotion and
has an aesthetic effect on human mind. Almost all the ancient literature is in
poetical form in any language.
Generally prose is for information and poetry is for appreciation. Poetry gives,
very briefly, details and facts in a beautiful form. Poetry is highly rhythmic in
character. Every prose lesson need not be a piece of literature, but every poem is
surely and invariably a piece of literature. So every teacher should develop a
taste for literature. She has to present the poem in such a way that it appeals to
the emotions of children. While learning a poem the child enters a different
world other than this physical world. The child should feel that it is experiencing
a new joy in a new atmosphere.
For poetry to remain poetry, there must be a direct contact between the poet
and the child without any intermediary or an interpreter. The problem is how to
bring this about? This will be discussed in this unit.
This unit aims at helping you to understand the objectives of teaching a rhyme
in lower classes and poems in higher classes. It also outlines the process of
teaching a rhyme and a poem. Also you are provided with suitable and simple
examples for teaching a rhyme and a poem for your practice training. Do the
tasks yourself and enjoy teaching a poem. And only if you try to enjoy the poetry
you teach, you will be able to convey the feelings of pleasure and appreciation to
your pupils.
Development of the Unit
TEACHING RHYMES
The first and the strong link between the children and the English language
(any language for that matter) can be only through nursery rhymes. The term
nursery is apt because just as in a Nursery growing the saplings, the rhymes
take care of the language to be developed later. We all know how children enjoy
saying a rhyme in lower classes with movement, gestures and most important
their expressions. Every child becomes one with the rhyme when taught properly
with the teacher’s enthusiasm.
The importance of saying (reciting) or singing rhymes:
Rhymes –
- strengthen and develop the memory power.
- develop active power of imitation and imagination.
- train the ears to the delicate varieties of sounds and rhythm.
217
- widen the knowledge of vocabulary.
- develop a sense of achievement and confidence in the young learners
- lay a strong foundation for speech work.
- are an excellent aid to correct speech.
The strong rhythm in the rhymes are also present in the basic speech pattern.
Hence rhymes help pick up fluency.
Suggestions for teaching Nursery Rhymes:
1. Any rhyme is essentially music – Hence it is meant to be said aloud to enjoy
the music.
2. Explanation of words, phrases or grammatical forms should not be given.
3. In every rhyme, the unfamiliar, tricky words should be singled out and their
correct pronunciation should be drilled.
4. Pupils’ attention should be concentrated on the words and phrases with
their correct beats.
5. Beats are to be given only with the use of two fingers on the left or right
palm.
Clapping or tapping the desk by the pupils should be avoided.
6. Children to be taught to feel the charm of music and rhythm.
7. Rhymes should be taught at first, moderately slowly until the pupils are able
to recite them correctly, clearly and confidently.
8. Once the children are confident in saying all the lines in the rhyme you can
give practice:
a) You say the first line; the children say the second line.
This alternative line practice can be continued changing roles also. (First
line - children; second line - teacher)
This line by line practice is helpful to correct the mispronounced words.
b) Practice in groups- one group one line.
c) Practice in pairs:
 d) Whole class says the rhyme.
All these practices will help even the slow learner to gain confidence in saying
the rhymes.
218
Don’ts
1. Do not ask individuals to say the rhyme in the beginning, in order to correct
their pronunciation.
The child may feel diffident.
2. Do not try to teach any morals through the rhymes.
3. Do not sing the rhyme to begin with.
Singing can be postponed till all the children are able to say the rhyme
correctly. This is because while singing, the children’s attention is drawntowards
the tune and not on the pronunciation.
4. While saying / singing rhymes can be done at the beginning or at the end of
every day class (as some teachers use it as motivation), care should be
taken not to spend more than 3 minutes on rhymes each day.
5. The most important point every teacher should remember - do not read out
the rhyme from the books – memorise and say the rhyme facing the children
with proper pronunciation, gestures and voice modulation for the children
to imitate and follow.
‘A Little Seed’
A little seed for me to sow
A little earth to make it grow.
A little hole,
A little pat,
A little wish,
And that is that.
A little sun,
A little shower,
A little while,
And then – a flower.
If you read out this from the book, the rhyme loses its life.
This should be acted out by you. Only then it appeals to the emotion of the
children –
Show gestures - a little pat,
a little wish,
How beautifully the child feels about the new plant it visualises.
The emotion should be brought out with the nicest expression.
If possible take the children out of the class. Or you can make a seed bed on
the table, use picture of sunshine and shower or draw it on the blackboard.
Think of a simple device to bring shower in the classroom.
This beautiful rhyme would never be forgotten if you teach it in such a way
that every child acts it out.
219
You’ll see the ‘child’ in you jumping out. You’ll relive your childhood days.
Introducing poems
As already mentioned in the introductory part of this unit poetry is meant
for enjoyment and pleasure as it appeals to our senses.
Many teachers have this problem in their classroom – while their pupils
have thoroughly enjoyed nursery rhymes and other rhythmic activities, they often
lose their interest in poetry as they are promoted through the school – and also
as poetry presented to them takes on a more elaborate form. It would be well,
therefore, if the teachers had in mind these standpoints.
First of all she should remember that rhythm is a universal phenomenon
wherever movement occurs. The regular rhythm of poetry appeals to the child as
something which satisfies an urge to move and speak rhythmically.
Secondly, poetry draws the child more and more towards, beauty, especially
beauty of language and thought and helps him develop his imagination.
This should not be regarded as the ‘aim’ of teaching poetry in the way that
we think of the aims of teaching other activities in the curriculum.
In fact to use the phrase ‘Teaching poetry’ is to emphasize a wrong point of
view. We do not `teach poetry’ and could not if we tried. We introduce it as an
activity because it gives pleasure as in doing any other activity in the classroom.
There is an incidental value in the inclusion of poetry in the curriculum in
that activities connected with the learning and appreciation of poetry should
have a beneficial effect upon the pupil’s speech and in the higher classes upon
his written English. This is an incidental advantage.
We should frequently remind ourselves of these points and never allow the
poetry class to develop into a mere soulless repetition of the poem until it is
known by the class as a whole.
Our chief focus should be to help our students appreciate and enjoy poem
and in the process they themselves would like to commit it to memory.
How could this be achieved in the class?
The teacher should read, listen to and enjoy good poems himself / herself.
It is difficult to arouse enthusiasm in others if you have no enthusiasm yourselves.
The emotion aroused by poetry can be transferred from the teacher to the pupil.
Indeed if this does not take place in the first instance, there is little hope for the
pupil’s acquiring a feeling for poetry.
220
The appreciation of poetry or any form of literature is a matter of enthusiasm.
If this is found in the teacher, it will be transferred almost automatically to the
students. If you try to enjoy the poems you teach to your students, you will be
able to convey the feelings of pleasure and appreciation that you feel by yourselves.
Now the question is –
How much of this can we get across to students with their limited vocabulary
and an uncertain grasp of the structures of the second language viz. English?
A few suggestions may be of some use:
a) The message of the poem is more important than its details.
b) The most difficult line should be studied last. The significance is understood
when the main theme of the poem has been grasped.
c) Elucidation by questioning creates a more effective contact between the
poem / poet and the student than elaborate explanation and paraphrase.
d) Presentation of the poem should be done orally through speech –with the
books closed. Why?
i) Poetry is memorable and eloquent speech. The poet speaks to us through
his poem. When we present poem orally though speech, the eyes of the
learner are free to see the imagery in the poem and not tied down to the
book to decipher the print.
Remember all our ancient literature - and all of them in poetical form –
were passed on through generations only orally and not through printed
pages. Delight in listening to poetry seems to be natural to any language
user.
ii) Rhyme and rhythm appeal primarily to the ear.
It is necessary that the student must be helped with pronunciation, rhythm
and intonation of a poem. He cannot be expected to read the poem to himself
to get a proper impression of the sound effect. So the teacher should present
the poem orally with proper sounds and rhythm whose charm will definitely
draw him towards enjoyment and appreciation of the poem.
iii) Poetry is easier to understand when it is read aloud / presented by a fluent
and understanding teacher. The teacher helps his students to live in the
poem by his reading and fortifies it with expression on his / her face. As a
result the poem will take shape in the mind of the listener. This shape will
become clearer and more precise with repeated listening / sessions.
iv) If we read the poem aloud or recite a poem, we leave the students no other
possibility to deal with it but to listen and concentrate all their attention on
listening.
It is natural for anyone who listens to a poem to pass over whatever is not
immediately comprehensible. But we grasp what we can and the very
swiftness of the impression causes us to have a good grip on what we do
catch. This gives a scattered series of focused impression. Some fainter
than the others. If we concentrate on what we have grasped, the patches of
impression seem to fuse and indicate a complete picture.
221
e) Good art can be allowed to make its own impact on the children about the
poem. The poet is sure to capture the imagination and arouse delight.
So for the sake of convenience and from the practical standpoint, we may
make three simple rules for classroom transaction.
1) Too much of explanation is a mistake.
2) Verbal peculiarities should be passed over / neglected – unless the students
ask. e.g. doth, thou, thee, thy, thine.
They can simply be said to be the variants of does, you, your and your
respectively and stopped at that. If the function is clear they will not delay
the perception of the poem.
Yon, or Yonder can be taught through gesture – pointing to a distance.
3) Student’s appreciation and understanding of the poem and sharing of the
poet’s experience can be expressed through art in the form of drawing /
dramatization. We should encourage pupils to do these activities at the end
of the class.
Let’s now see a sample lesson on introducing a poem:
“The Coromandel Fishers” by poet Sarojini Naidu.
Rise, brothers rise, the waking skies
Pray to the morning light
The wind lies asleep in the arms of the dawn
like a child that has cried all night.
Come, let us gather our nets from the shore
And set our catamarans free,
To capture the leaping wealth of the tide
For we are the sons of the sea.
The process of teaching the poem can be in three main stages.
1. Preparation 2. Presentation 3. Discussion
1. Preparation
a) Equipping the students for a quick grasp of the main outline of the poem.
b) Familiarising (not through explanation) them with the most important words
and expressions.
c) Ensuring that the ideas involved in the poem are not beyond his reach.
These can be done by eliciting responses through simple questions as follows:
(The books remain closed).
Teacher : How many of you have seen the sea? /
How many of you have been to the beach?
(A few students raise their hands)
Teacher : Not even in films / TV?
Class : Yes! Yes!
222
Teacher : Good, now tell me, what you have seen on the seashore.
Answer one by one.
Student 1 : boats
Student 2 : huts
Student 3 : shells
Student 4 : fishman.
Teacher : Yes, fisherman. Or you can also call them fishers.
(A few students murmer ‘fishers’)
Good! say that!
Class : Fishers.
Teacher : Good! The fishers! What do they do?
Student 5 : Catch fish.
Teacher : Good! When do they set out to catch fish? (Show
gestures)
Class : (Silent)
Teacher : In the night?
Student 6 : No. early in the morning,
Teacher : Yes! You’re right.
I’m going to recite a poem on fishermen. They are also
called.........
Student 7 : Fishers!
Teacher : Good: Can you tell me what is the east coast of India
called? – (point to the coast on the map on the wall).
This part
Class : (Silent)
Teacher : I’ll give you a clue. There is a train from Chennai to
Calcutta.
It’s named after the coast.
Student 8 : Coromandel Express?
Teacher : Exactly! the east coast is called the Coromandel coast.
Our poem is on the Coromandel fishers. I’m going to recite it.You are not going to open
your books. Listen to the poem carefully.
2. Presentation
The teacher recites / reads out the poem with the proper pronunciation
intonation and facial expression (A second reading / recital can also be done if
necessary).
3. Discussion – Books Open
The teacher need not explain every word or every line. She can ask simple
questions to ensure whether the pupils have understood the poem. Even if a
few students ask the meaning of words like catamarans, leaping wealth, she
can show pictures, or pose questions to the class and elicit the answer.
223
For example:
Student 1 : What are catamarans?
Teacher : How do fisherman go into the sea?
Class : (Silent)
Teacher : Swimming?
Student 2 : No
Teacher : Then? By ships?
Student 3 : By boats.
Teacher : Some fishermen go by machine boats. Not all.
Student 4 : Yes, some by small boats.
Student 5 : Not big.
Teacher : You’re right. They go by catamarans. There is a similar
word in Tamil.
Student 6 : Kattumaram
Teacher : Excellent!
Student 7 : What’s ‘leaping wealth’?
Teacher : Can any one answer his question?
Class : (Silent)
Teacher : What do fishermen get from the sea?
Class : Fish
Teacher : Yes, that’s the wealth they get from the sea. Just as
the wealth the former gets from the land. Do fish keep
quiet in the sea?
Class : No they move fast, They jump,
Teacher : That’s why the poet calls them leaping wealth.
The significance of such difficult lines as,
“The wind lies asleep in the arms of the dawn.
Like a child that cried all night”
can be easily understood when the main theme of the poem had been grasped.
Even if question persist from the children on these lines teacher can draw
out the answer from them through question like this–
Teacher : Do you find heavy winds early in the morning on the
sea shore.
Student 1 : No, it is calm / silent.
Teacher : What has the wind done all night?
Tell me from the line in the poem.
Student 2 : Like a child cried all night.
Then the teacher can initiate the discussion on the poet.
224
Further reading
When the whole poem has been presented and discussed this way, it may be
read over by the teacher again once or twice (depending on the students’
need). As you do so, you may deliberately pause to give the pupils opportunity
to read out the next few phrases. At the end the students will be eager to
read the poem themselves. This can be done individually or in smaller groups.
As a concluding part of discussion, you may initiate the children
a) to quote parallel incidents / recite poems in their mother tongue with
parallel themes.
b) to draw pictures or paint some beautiful scenes that appeal to their mind.
c) to enact the poem.
d) to pick out the rhyming words in the poem.
3. Conclusion
The process of teaching a poem can be summed up in three main stages:
a) Preparation : Equipping the students for a quick grasp of the main theme.
b) Presentation and reading including a great deal of re-reading; elicitation
arousing interest and calling for intense concentration on the word –
pictures (imagery) in the poem.
c) Discussion should lead the pupils on to a thorugh knowledge of the text of
the poem and the ideas it embodies.
Summing up
1. The objective of teaching poetry is to help pupils enjoy and appreciate it.
2. We would present poems orally; it is better if the teacher recites them
from memory.
3. Poetry appeals to the ears more than the eyes.
4. Poetry is meant to be read aloud as otherwise the effect of rhyme and
rhythm will be lost.
5. Rhymes and songs help fluency.
6. The teacher’s role is to introduce the poem / poet to the pupils.
7. Elucidation by questioning brings the poem / poet nearer to the pupils than
hours of explanation and interpretation.
8. Poems in the mother tongue on parallel themes can be recited to create a
taste for the new medium.
9. Art work – drawing painting / dramatisation at the end gives scope for
students to express and their “feeling” of the poem.
225
Task : 4
Read out the poem to your classmates and do the task given below.
DAY BREAK
A wind came up out of the sea,
And said, “O mists, make room for me”,
It hailed the ships and cried, “Sail on,
Ye mariners, the night is gone”,
And hurried landward far away,
Crying, “Awake, it is the day”.
It said unto the forest, “shout!”
Hang all your leafy banners out!”,
It touched the wood-bird’s folded wing,
And said, “O bird, awake and sing”.
An O’ever the farms, “O, Chanticlear,
Your clarion blow; the day is near”,
It whispered to the field of corn,
“Bow down, and hail the coming morn”,
It shouted through the bellfry – tower,
“Awake, o Bell! proclaim the hour”.
It crossed the church yard with a sigh,
and said,” Not yet! in quiet lie”.
- H.W. Longfellow
Note:
If you come across any difficult word in the poem try to discuss it with your friend and
get the meaning with the help of the context.
226
Exploration :
Did the tasks help you get the feeling of the poet?
Were you able to live in the poems?
Draw / Dramatise the scene in the poem.
You may encounter a few problems in classroom. As already discussed, the aim of
teaching a rhyme / poem is to help children enjoy and appreciate it. So never
explain line by line.
The major problems that may arise in the lower classes is the pronunciation.
Especially the unfamiliar (non-Tamil) sounds like ‘sh’ and ‘f’ & ‘z’.
You may come across children having difficulty in pronouncing words with sounds
that are not in their mother tongue.
‘Sh’
Words having ‘sh’ can be introduced with the support of pictures or real objects
First by giving clues orally with gestures. The children can answer in chorus.
Something the boys and girls wear ...... sh ________.
Something to wash our hair with ...... sh _________.
Something we wear on our feet ...... sh _________.
An animal that lives in water ...... _________ sh.
(some of us eat it)
A place were we buy things from ...... sh ________
Ask children to practise saying this:
a) I wish for a fish to swish in my dish.
b) She sells sea shells on the sea – shore.
c) Half a cup of coffee in a proper copper coffee pot.
Then the children can write the words individually.
Here are a few Tongue Twisting Exercises at your - the trainee’s level by Dr.
Seus. Dr. Seus has written many books full of Tongue Twisters like (1) ABC . . . (2)
Wocket in my Pocket (3) Foot Book (4) Nose Book (5) I can Read with my Eyes Shut

Try saying them repeatedly :
1. “Skipper Zipp’s shop”
If you like to eat potato chips.
And chew pork chops
I suggest that you chew
a few chips and a chop
at Skipper Zipp’s chip – chop shop
And if your tongue is getting queasy
don’t give up.
The next one is easy
2. Do you like fresh fish?
It’s just fine at Finney’s Diner
Finney also has some fresher fish
that’s fresher and much finer
But his best fish is his fried fish.
and Finney says with pride,
“The finest fish at Finney’s
is my freshest fish, French Fried!”
So......
don’t order the fresh
or the fresher fish
At Finney’s,
If you’re wise, you’ll say,
“Fetch me the finest
French fried freshest
Fish that Finney fries!”
3. Ape Cakes Grape Cakes
As he gobbled the cakes on his plate,
the greedy ape said as he ate
“The greener green grapes are,
the keener keen apes are
to gobble green grape cakes,
They’re Great!”
4. West Beast East Beast
Upon an island hard to reach
Are you having trouble
in saying this stuff?
It’s really quite easy for me
I just look in my mirror
and see what I say,
and then I just say what I see.
the East Beast sits up on his beach
Upon the west beach sits the West Beast.
Each beach beast thinks he’s the best beast
Which beast is the best?----Well, I thought at first
that the East was the best and the West was the worst.
Then I looked again from the west to the east.
and I liked the beast on the east beach least.
Task 6
Writing Acrostics :
An acrostic is a poem written where the first letter of each line put together spells a word. The

Each has its own shape and size.
Caterpillar, gnats, a bee
Take them all away from me!

In our world a rich man buys almost everything, he can own an aeroplane, a luxury yacht and a
number of beautiful cars. But there is one thing that he cannot buy – good health. Good health is man’s
precious possession.
A healthy mind in a healthy body is what makes life worth living. And the two things, good health and
a sound mind, always go together. Without a healthy body man may neither think great thoughts nor
perform great acts.
For good health good food is very essential and this need not always be non-vegetarian food. Vegetarians
are often as healthy as meat eaters. Besides good food, our bodies require several other things to
stay healthy and to become strong. They require fresh air and clean water. They also require a lot of
exercise. Equally important is sleep and rest to which we must give sufficient time every day.
Doctors tell us that some things work against good health. Smoking is one of these. A smoker
contracts more diseases and does so oftener than a non-smoker. Another bad thing is eating too much. A
very thin person may not be a healthy person but a very fat man never is. That is why doctor advises fat
people to eat less and to give up fatty foods. A third thing that goes against good health is irregular habits,
such as eating at odd or wrong hours, going to bed very late, and not doing one’s work at regular hours.
239
